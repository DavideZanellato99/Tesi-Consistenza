"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing an array with an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the array's size, or when dereferencing a pointer that points to a memory location outside the allocated region.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the source pointer `ss`. If `early` is non-zero, this can result in `ss` pointing to a memory location before the beginning of the `src->data` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `ss` is dereferenced within the composition functions (e.g., `jbig2_image_compose_opt_OR`). The value of `early` is determined by `x >= 0`, and `x` is an input value."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when an index or pointer is not properly validated before being used to access memory.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the source pointer `ss`.

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region.
