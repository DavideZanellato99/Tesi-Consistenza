"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the code does not properly validate the size of the input data or when the code uses an incorrect index to access the buffer.","The code iterates through interfaces based on values in the `assoc->bInterfaceCount` and `assoc->bFirstInterface` fields. If these values are maliciously crafted (e.g., `bInterfaceCount` is very large and `bFirstInterface` is small), the loop could iterate through a large number of interfaces, potentially accessing invalid or out-of-bounds interface descriptors, leading to a denial of service or information leak."
