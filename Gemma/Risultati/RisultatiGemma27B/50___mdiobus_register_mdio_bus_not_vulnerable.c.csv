"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The software does not properly validate input used in a time-related function, potentially leading to timing-based vulnerabilities.","The code uses `udelay(bus->reset_delay_us)` which can lead to timing vulnerabilities. The delay is based on user-controlled input (`bus->reset_delay_us`), potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the timing of the reset signal and cause denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
