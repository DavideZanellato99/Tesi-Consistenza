"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data to a buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code calculates the length of the key using `strlen(hostname) + 1 + port_str.length()`. However, it then allocates a `String` with this length using `String(key_len, ReserveString)`. The `ReserveString` constructor does *not* null-terminate the string. Subsequently, the code appends `hostname`, "":"", and `port_str` to the `key` string using the `+=` operator. This operator *does* null-terminate the string. If the combined length of `hostname`, "":"", and `port_str` exceeds `key_len`, a buffer overflow will occur during the `+=` operations, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior."

"5","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data into a buffer without checking the size of the input, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the initial allocation of the `key` string might be too small, and the subsequent appends with null termination can overflow the buffer.","The code calculates the length of the key using `strlen(hostname) + 1 + port_str.length()`. However, it then allocates a `String` with this length using `String(key_len, ReserveString)`. The `ReserveString` constructor does *not* null-terminate the string. Subsequently, the code appends `hostname`, "":"", and `port_str` to the `key` string using the `+=` operator. This operator *does* null-terminate the string. If `hostname` or `port_str` are unexpectedly long, the initial allocation of `key` might be insufficient, leading to a heap buffer overflow when the `+=` operator attempts to null-terminate the string."
