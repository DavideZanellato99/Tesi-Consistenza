"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate the size of a buffer before copying data into it, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `fib_dump_info` function. The `res.prefix` variable, which represents the network prefix, is used directly as a size parameter in `fib_dump_info` without proper validation. An attacker controlling the network prefix length (`res.prefixlen`) within the `rtmsg` structure can potentially cause `fib_dump_info` to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow."
"2","True","CWE-127","Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a buffer, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `fib_dump_info` function. The `res.prefix` variable, which represents the network prefix, is used directly as a size parameter in a memory copy operation within `fib_dump_info` without proper validation. An attacker controlling the `res.prefix` value through crafted network packets can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"3","True","CWE-122","Heap Based Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate the size of memory allocations, leading to a buffer overflow when writing data to a heap buffer.

"5","True","CWE-200","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The software deserializes untrusted data without properly validating or sanitizing it, which can lead to various vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or arbitrary code execution. In this case, the untrusted data is the IP address provided in the netlink message.","The code uses `nla_get_in_addr` to retrieve the source and destination addresses from the `tb` array, which are then directly assigned to `ip_hdr(skb)->saddr` and `ip_hdr(skb)->daddr` respectively. There is no validation performed on the retrieved addresses. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious netlink message with invalid or crafted IP addresses, leading to a use-after-free or other memory corruption vulnerabilities when the kernel attempts to process the packet with these addresses."
