"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate a pathname to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or modification of system files.","The code copies files from a zip archive to a destination path. It attempts to handle filenames encoded in IBM437 by creating a second copy of the file with the IBM437-decoded filename. However, it doesn't properly sanitize the `cp437_file_name` before using it to create a new file path. This can lead to a path traversal vulnerability if the zip archive contains a filename crafted to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ""../../../""). The `QFile::copy` function will then create files outside the intended destination directory."

This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or modification of critical system files.","The code copies files from a zip archive to a destination path. It attempts to handle filenames encoded in IBM437 by creating a second copy of the file with the IBM437-decoded filename if the decoded filename differs from the UTF-8 decoded filename. This can lead to a path traversal vulnerability if the zip archive contains filenames crafted to exploit this behavior, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended destination directory. Specifically, a filename like ""../../../evil.txt"" could be used to write a file to an arbitrary location on the filesystem."
