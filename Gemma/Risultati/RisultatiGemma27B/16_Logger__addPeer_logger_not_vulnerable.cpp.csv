"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the results of integer operations, leading to an overflow or wraparound. This can cause the program to behave in an unexpected manner, potentially leading to crashes, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in `peerCounter++`. If `peerCounter` reaches its maximum value (e.g., `INT_MAX` for a 32-bit integer), incrementing it will cause it to wrap around to the minimum value (e.g., `INT_MIN`). This can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially causing issues with indexing or comparisons related to `peerCounter`. While not directly exploitable for remote code execution, it can lead to denial of service or incorrect logging."
