"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the results of an integer operation, leading to an overflow or wraparound. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or buffer overflows.","The code subtracts `buf_size` from `dctx->remaining` without checking if `buf_size` is greater than `dctx->remaining`. This can lead to an integer underflow, resulting in a large positive value for `dctx->remaining`. Subsequently, the condition `buf_size - i + 47 >= dctx->remaining` can become true even when it shouldn't be, potentially leading to incorrect frame size calculations and buffer overflows in subsequent processing."
