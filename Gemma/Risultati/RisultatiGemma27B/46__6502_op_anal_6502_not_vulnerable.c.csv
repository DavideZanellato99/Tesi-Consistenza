"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a data block into a buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code uses `r_strbuf_setf` and `r_strbuf_set` to construct ESIL strings based on input data without proper length validation. Specifically, the `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern1`, `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern2`, and `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern3` functions likely copy data into the `addrbuf` buffer, which has a fixed size of 64 bytes. If these functions do not properly limit the amount of data copied, a buffer overflow can occur, leading to arbitrary code execution. The subsequent use of `r_strbuf_setf` with the potentially overflowing `addrbuf` then creates a vulnerability in the ESIL string construction."
