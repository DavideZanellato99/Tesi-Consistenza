"1","True","CWE-284","Improper Access Control","The software does not properly validate or sanitize input values, leading to an attempt to modify data in a location that the software is not authorized to access.","The function `mpol_parse_str` modifies the input string `str` by inserting null terminators at the positions of ':' and '=' characters. However, it restores these characters before returning. If the input string `str` is a string literal or resides in read-only memory, this modification will lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-284","Improper Access Control","The software does not properly validate or sanitize input values, leading to an attempt to access or modify resources in an unauthorized manner. In this case, the attempt to modify a read-only string literal leads to a crash.","The function `mpol_parse_str` modifies the input string `str` by inserting null terminators at the positions of ':' and '=' characters. However, it restores these characters before returning.

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overwrite","The software writes to a buffer after the buffer's boundaries have been exceeded.","The function `mpol_parse_str` modifies the input string `str` by inserting null terminators at the positions of ':' and '=' characters using pointer arithmetic (`*flags++ = '\0'`, `*nodelist++ = '\0'`). If the input string `str` is a constant string literal or resides in read-only memory, this write operation will cause a segmentation fault or other memory access violation."
