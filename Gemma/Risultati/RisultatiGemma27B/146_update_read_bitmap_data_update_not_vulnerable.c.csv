"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Overflow","The application does not properly validate the size of the input data before copying it into a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code reads `bitmapData->bitmapLength` from the stream and then allocates memory using `malloc` with this length. If an attacker can control the value of `bitmapData->bitmapLength` (through manipulating the input stream), they can cause an integer overflow, leading to a small allocation size. Subsequently, `memcpy` will write beyond the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow. This is especially dangerous if `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is set to a very large value, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the code does not properly validate the size of the data being read, or when the buffer is not large enough to hold the data.","The code reads `bitmapData->bitmapLength` from the stream and then allocates memory using `malloc` with this length. If an attacker can control the value of `bitmapData->bitmapLength` and set it to a very large value, this can lead to a heap overflow when `malloc` is called. The code checks `Stream_GetRemainingLength(s) < bitmapData->bitmapLength` before the `malloc` and `memcpy`, but the value of `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is determined by the stream data itself, making this check ineffective against a malicious stream."
