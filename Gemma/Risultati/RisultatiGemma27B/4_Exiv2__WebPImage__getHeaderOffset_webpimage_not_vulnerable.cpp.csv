"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the result of an integer subtraction, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the loop to iterate more times than intended, potentially leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. Inside the loop, `memcmp` compares `header` with a slice of `data` starting at index `i`. If `header_size` is large, and `data_size` is also large, `data_size - header_size` could potentially overflow, leading to a very large loop iteration count. While the loop condition prevents reading beyond `data_size`, the subtraction itself can overflow, resulting in a large positive value, effectively causing the loop to iterate much more than intended. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially other unexpected behavior."

While the loop condition prevents reading beyond `data_size`, the subtraction itself can overflow, resulting in a very large positive value for `data_size - header_size`. This causes the loop to iterate many more times than intended, potentially leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer before performing an operation that could cause it to overflow or wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. Inside the loop, `memcmp` compares `header` with a slice of `data` starting at index `i`. If `header_size` is large, and `data_size` is also large, `data_size - header_size` could potentially overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `i` approaches its maximum value. Specifically, if `data_size` is close to the maximum value of `long`, subtracting `header_size` could result in a negative value, which then wraps around to a large positive value. The loop then iterates up to this large positive value, causing it to read beyond the bounds of the `data` buffer."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the result of an integer subtraction, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the loop to iterate beyond the bounds of the input buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. Inside the loop, `memcmp` compares `header` with a slice of `data` starting at index `i`. If `header_size` is large, and `data_size` is also large, `data_size - header_size` could potentially overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `i` approaches `data_size`. Specifically, if `data_size` is close to the maximum value of `long`, subtracting `header_size` could result in a negative value, and the loop condition `i < data_size - header_size` would become true for large values of `i`, causing `&data[i]` to access memory outside the bounds of the `data` buffer."
"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the result of an integer subtraction, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the loop to iterate an unexpectedly large number of times, potentially leading to a denial of service or other vulnerabilities.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. Inside the loop, `memcmp` compares `header` with a slice of `data` starting at index `i`. If `header_size` is large, and `data_size` is also large, `data_size - header_size` could potentially overflow, leading to a very large loop iteration count. While the loop condition prevents reading beyond `data_size`, the subtraction itself can overflow, resulting in a very large positive value for `data_size - header_size`. This causes the loop to iterate far beyond the intended bounds of the `data` buffer, potentially leading to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
