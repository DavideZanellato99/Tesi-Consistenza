"1","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","The code accesses memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to a heap use-after-free in the `php_wddx_pop_element` function. Specifically, within the `if (stack->top > 1)` block, after potentially merging hashtables and creating a new object, the code cleans up `ent1` using `efree(ent1)`. However, `ent1`'s `varname` field might still be referenced within the `zend_hash_merge` function if `incomplete_class` is 0, leading to a use-after-free when `zend_hash_merge` attempts to access the freed memory."
"2","True","CWE-434","Use-After-Free","The software attempts to access data after it has been freed. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap use-after-free in the `php_wddx_pop_element` function. Specifically, within the `if (stack->top > 1)` block, after `zval_ptr_dtor(&ent1->data);` and `efree(ent1);`, the code proceeds to access `ent1->varname` in `efree(ent1->varname);`. Since `ent1` has been freed, accessing `ent1->varname` results in a use-after-free vulnerability."
"3","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","The software accesses memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to a heap use-after-free in the `php_wddx_pop_element` function. Specifically, within the `if (stack->top > 1)` block, after potentially merging hashtables and creating a new object, the code cleans up `ent1` using `efree(ent1)`. However, `ent1`'s `varname` field might still be referenced within the `zend_hash_next_index_insert` function if the `else` branch is taken. This leads to a use-after-free vulnerability when `zend_hash_next_index_insert` attempts to access the freed memory pointed to by `ent1->varname`."
