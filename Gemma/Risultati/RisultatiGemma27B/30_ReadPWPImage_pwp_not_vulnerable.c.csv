"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer before performing an operation that could cause it to overflow or wrap around. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as memory corruption or denial of service.","The code calculates `filesize` using `magick[0]`, `magick[1]`, and `magick[2]` which are read directly from the input blob. These values are not validated and are used in a calculation that determines the size of a buffer to be allocated or read into. This can lead to an integer overflow or underflow, resulting in a heap buffer overflow or underflow when reading the file."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the results of integer arithmetic operations, potentially leading to an overflow or wraparound. This can cause memory corruption, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior.","The code calculates `filesize` using `magick[0]`, `magick[1]`, and `magick[2]` which are read directly from the input blob. These values are not validated and are used in a calculation that determines the size of a buffer to be allocated or read into. An attacker could potentially control these values to cause an integer overflow or underflow, leading to a buffer overflow or underflow when reading the file."
