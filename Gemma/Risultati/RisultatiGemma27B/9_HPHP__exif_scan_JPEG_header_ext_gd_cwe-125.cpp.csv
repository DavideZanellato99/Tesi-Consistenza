"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the code does not properly validate the size of the data being read, or when the buffer is not large enough to hold the data.","The code reads the length of a JPEG section from the file using `ImageInfo->infile->getc()` and stores it in `lh` and `ll`. These values are then combined to form `itemlen`. However, there is no check to ensure that `itemlen` is within reasonable bounds before being used in subsequent operations like `ImageInfo->infile->read(itemlen-2)` and `memcpy(Data+2, str.c_str(), got)`. A maliciously crafted JPEG file could provide a very large value for `itemlen`, leading to a large memory allocation in `exif_file_sections_add` and potentially a heap overflow in `ImageInfo->infile->read` or `memcpy`. This could result in a denial of service or even arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when reading from an array, buffer, or other data structure.
