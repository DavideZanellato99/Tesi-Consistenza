"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code reads data from a stream `is` using `OPENEXR_IMF_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE::Xdr::read`. The size of the data read is determined by variables like `chunksize`, `packed_offset`, and `packed_sample` which are read directly from the stream. If the stream is malicious or corrupted, these values could be manipulated to be very large, leading to an integer overflow when calculating `size_of_chunk`. This could result in a large allocation or read beyond the bounds of the buffer, leading to a heap overflow or other memory corruption vulnerabilities."
