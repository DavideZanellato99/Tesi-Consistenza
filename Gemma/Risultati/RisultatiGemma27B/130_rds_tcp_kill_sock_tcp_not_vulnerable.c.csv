"1","True","CWE-440","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The software attempts to deserialize data without sufficiently validating the data, which could lead to a denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates through a list of TCP connections and attempts to disconnect and destroy them. However, the `tcp_done(sk)` function can potentially call `sock_release()` which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the socket `sk` is already freed or released elsewhere. This is especially concerning in a concurrent environment where multiple threads or processes might be accessing the same socket."

"4","True","CWE-448","Use After Free","The code uses a pointer after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.","The code iterates through a list of TCP connections and attempts to disconnect and destroy them. However, the `tcp_done(sk)` function can potentially lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the socket `sk` is already freed or becomes invalid before `tcp_done` is called. This can happen due to concurrent operations on the socket."
