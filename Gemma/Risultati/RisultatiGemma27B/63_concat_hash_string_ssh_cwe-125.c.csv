"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Over-Read","The software reads data from a buffer but does not check whether the read is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to an information leak or other security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `strncpy` without ensuring null termination of the copied string. If the length `len` read from the packet is equal to the buffer size, `strncpy` will copy `len` bytes without adding a null terminator, leading to a buffer overflow when `buf` is later used as a string."
