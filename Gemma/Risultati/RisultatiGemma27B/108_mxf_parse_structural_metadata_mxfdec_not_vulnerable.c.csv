"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The software does not handle a NULL pointer value properly, which can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.","The code uses `mxf_resolve_strong_ref` to resolve references to MXF objects. If these references are invalid or point to uninitialized memory, it can lead to a crash or undefined behavior. The code does not adequately check the return value of `mxf_resolve_strong_ref` in all cases, potentially dereferencing a null pointer. Specifically, the code continues execution even if `mxf_resolve_strong_ref` fails, leading to potential null pointer dereferences later on."
"2","True","CWE-660","Improper Initialization","The software does not properly initialize a pointer before it is used. This can lead to a variety of problems, including crashes, memory corruption, and security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `mxf_resolve_strong_ref` to resolve references to MXF objects. If these references are invalid or point to uninitialized memory, it can lead to a crash or undefined behavior. The code does not adequately check the return values of `mxf_resolve_strong_ref` in all cases, potentially dereferencing null pointers. Specifically, there are multiple instances where the return value is checked, but if it's null, the code continues to the next iteration without properly handling the error, potentially leading to a use-after-free or null pointer dereference later on."
