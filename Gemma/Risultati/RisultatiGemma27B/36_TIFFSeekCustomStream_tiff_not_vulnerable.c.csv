"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer expression, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations, memory corruption, or denial of service.","The code does not properly handle potential integer overflows when calculating the new offset in the SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END cases. Specifically, the checks `(offset > 0) && (profile->offset > (SSIZE_MAX-offset))` and `(offset < 0) && (profile->offset < (-SSIZE_MAX-offset))` are insufficient to prevent overflows when adding `offset` to `profile->offset` or `profile->length`. Additionally, the check `(profile->offset+offset) < 0` in SEEK_CUR is not sufficient to prevent overflows."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer expression, potentially leading to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the program to behave in unexpected ways, such as crashing or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code does not properly validate the `offset` and `profile->length` values, potentially leading to integer overflow or underflow when calculating `profile->offset`. Specifically, the `SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END` cases have checks for overflow/underflow, but these checks are insufficient to prevent all possible issues, and the `SEEK_SET` case has no checks at all. An attacker could potentially manipulate these values to cause `profile->offset` to wrap around, leading to out-of-bounds access or other unexpected behavior."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the results of integer operations, leading to an overflow or wraparound.
