"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The code writes to a heap buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `floppy_sizes[cnt] = floppy_sizes[cnt + 0x80] = floppy_type[type].size + 1;` within a loop where `type` is user-controlled. If `type` is sufficiently large, `cnt` can exceed the bounds of the `floppy_sizes` array, leading to a heap buffer overflow."
