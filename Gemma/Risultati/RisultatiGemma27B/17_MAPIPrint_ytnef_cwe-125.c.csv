"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when the read index is outside the valid range of indices for the buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `PT_STRING8` case within the loop that iterates through `mapi->data`. Specifically, `strlen((char*)mapidata->data)` is compared to `mapidata->size - 1`. If `strlen` returns a value equal to `mapidata->size`, the code proceeds to print potentially hidden data up to `mapidata->size`. However, `mapidata->data` is a `BYTE*`, and `strlen` expects a null-terminated string. If the data in `mapidata->data` is *not* null-terminated, `strlen` will read past the allocated buffer until it finds a null byte, potentially leading to a read beyond the bounds of the allocated memory. This can cause a crash or expose sensitive information."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region.

The vulnerability arises if the string pointed to by `mapidata->data` does *not* have a null terminator within the first `mapidata->size - 1` bytes.
