"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data to a buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code uses `fscanf` to read data from the input file. The format string ""%31[ \t]%c%c%31[ \t+-]%d%31[ \t]%d%31[ \t]%d"" does not limit the length of the input read into the `temp` buffers, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the input file contains strings longer than 31 characters."

"5","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data to a buffer without verifying that the size of the input data is less than or equal to the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the software to crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code uses `fscanf` to read data from the input file. The format string ""%31[ \t]%c%c%31[ \t+-]%d%31[ \t]%d%31[ \t]%d"" does not limit the number of characters read into the `temp` buffers, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the input file contains more than 31 characters for these fields. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution."
