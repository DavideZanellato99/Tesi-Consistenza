"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from one buffer into another without checking the size of the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the destination buffer.","The code reads 4 bytes from the network into the `authResult` variable without any bounds checking. If the server sends more than 4 bytes, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."
