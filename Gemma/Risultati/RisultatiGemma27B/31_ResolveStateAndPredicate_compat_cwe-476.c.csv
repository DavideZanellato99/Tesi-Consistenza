"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies a data block into a buffer without checking the size of the input data, which could lead to a buffer overflow.","The function `ResolveStateAndPredicate` uses `xkb_atom_text` to retrieve strings from an XKB context based on identifiers. These strings are then used in `LookupString` without any length validation. If a malicious actor can control the identifier used in `xkb_atom_text`, they could potentially provide a very long string, leading to a buffer overflow in `LookupString`."
