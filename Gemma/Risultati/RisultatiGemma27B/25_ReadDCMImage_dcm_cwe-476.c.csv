"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code reads data from a DICOM file without proper bounds checking, specifically in the `ReadBlob` calls and subsequent data processing. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the DICOM file contains maliciously crafted data with incorrect length fields. The code also uses `ReadBlobLSBShort` and `ReadBlobLSBLong` without validating the returned values before using them as sizes or offsets, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-memory (OOM)","The software does not properly handle situations where it cannot allocate enough memory to perform an operation, and may crash or behave in an unexpected manner.","The code reads data from a DICOM file without proper bounds checking, specifically in the loop where it reads data into `data` using `ReadBlob`. If the DICOM file is crafted maliciously with a large `datum` value, the `length` calculation (`length = (size_t) datum / quantum`) could result in a very large value. Subsequently, `AcquireQuantumMemory(length + 1, quantum * sizeof(*data))` could lead to a large memory allocation, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) via memory exhaustion."
