"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the results of integer arithmetic operations, leading to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the program to behave in unexpected ways, such as allocating insufficient memory or performing incorrect calculations.","The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the calculation of `state->bytes`. Specifically, the calculation `state->bytes = row_byte_size * tile_length;` or `state->bytes = rows_per_strip * row_byte_size;` can result in an integer overflow if the product exceeds `INT_MAX`. While there's a check `if (state->bytes > INT_MAX - 1)`, this check is performed *after* the multiplication, meaning the overflow has already occurred and `state->bytes` holds an incorrect, wrapped-around value. This incorrect value is then used in `realloc(state->buffer, state->bytes)`, potentially leading to a small allocation, and subsequent buffer overflow when writing data into `state->buffer`."
