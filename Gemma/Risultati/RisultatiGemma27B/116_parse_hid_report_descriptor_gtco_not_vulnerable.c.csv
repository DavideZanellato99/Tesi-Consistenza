"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash, information leak, or other unexpected behavior.","The code reads data from a report buffer without proper bounds checking after determining the size of the data to read. Specifically, the code calculates `size` based on the `prefix` and then checks `if (i + size > length)`. However, `i` is incremented *before* this check, meaning the check is performed against an already incremented `i`. This can lead to a read beyond the bounds of the `report` buffer if `size` is large enough, resulting in a buffer over-read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code reads data from a report buffer without proper bounds checking after determining the size of the data to read. Specifically, the code calculates `size` based on the `prefix` and then checks `if (i + size > length)`. However, `i` is incremented *before* this check, meaning the check is performed against an already advanced index. If `i + size` exceeds `length`, the code prints an error and breaks the loop, but it's possible for `i` to be incremented such that `i` is equal to `length` before the check, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `switch` statement when accessing `report[i]`, `report[i+1]`, or `report[i+2]`."
"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.

"4","True","CWE-287","Improper Authentication","The software does not properly validate the input, which can lead to an attacker bypassing authentication or authorization checks. In this case, the lack of alignment checks can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.","The code reads data from a report buffer without proper bounds checking after determining the size of the data to read. Specifically, the `if (i + size > length)` check only prevents reading past the end of the buffer when `size` is calculated. However, the `get_unaligned_le16` and `get_unaligned_le32` functions are used to read 2 and 4 bytes respectively, but there is no check to ensure that `i` is properly aligned before calling these functions. This can lead to an unaligned memory access, which can cause a crash or potentially allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory."
