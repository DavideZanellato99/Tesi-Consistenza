"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code copies data from `apdu.resp` to `out` using `memcpy(out, apdu.resp+offset, len-offset)`. The `offset` is calculated based on conditions related to `tcos3` and `data->pad_flags`. However, the code does not check if `offset` is within the bounds of `apdu.resplen`. If `offset` is greater than or equal to `apdu.resplen`, the `memcpy` will read beyond the bounds of `apdu.resp`, leading to a buffer over-read."
