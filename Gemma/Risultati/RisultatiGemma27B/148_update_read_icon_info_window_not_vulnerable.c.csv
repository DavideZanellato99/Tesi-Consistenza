"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-memory (OOM)","The software attempts to allocate memory but fails to do so, leading to an application crash or unexpected behavior. This can be caused by insufficient memory, memory fragmentation, or other resource limitations.","The code uses `realloc` to resize buffers (`iconInfo->bitsMask`, `iconInfo->colorTable`, `iconInfo->bitsColor`) based on values read from the stream (`iconInfo->cbBitsMask`, `iconInfo->cbColorTable`, `iconInfo->cbBitsColor`). If an attacker can control the values in the stream, they can provide a large value for `cbBitsMask`, `cbColorTable`, or `cbBitsColor`, leading to a large memory allocation. If the allocation fails, `realloc` returns NULL, and the code correctly handles this by freeing the existing buffer and setting the pointer to NULL. However, if the allocation succeeds, a large amount of memory will be allocated. While not a direct crash, this can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting available memory. Additionally, the repeated use of `realloc` can lead to memory fragmentation."
