"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can lead to a crash, information leak, or other unexpected behavior.","The code iterates through `passInstructions` using `k` and `input->chars` using `kk`. The increment of `kk` happens within the `if` condition (`kk++`). If the condition `passInstructions[k] != input->chars[kk++]` is true, `kk` is incremented, but `k` is not. This can lead to `kk` exceeding the bounds of `input->chars`, resulting in an out-of-bounds read."
