"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a data block into a buffer without checking the size of the input data block to ensure that it does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code uses `r_str_escape_utf8_for_json` to escape strings for JSON output, but it doesn't limit the length of the escaped string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string `symbol->name` is very long, as the allocated buffer for the escaped string might be insufficient."
