"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The application writes to a heap buffer after checking its size, but the size check is insufficient to prevent a buffer overflow. This can occur when the size of the buffer is calculated incorrectly or when the application does not account for null terminators or other overhead.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the loop where it processes answer resource records (RRs). Specifically, in the `T_CNAME` case, `ares_expand_name` is called to decode `rr_data`. If `rr_data` points to a large string within the `abuf` buffer, `ares_expand_name` could allocate a buffer smaller than the actual length of the string, leading to a heap buffer overflow when copying the data into the allocated buffer."
