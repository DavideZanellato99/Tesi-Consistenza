"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data from one buffer into another without checking the size of the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the destination buffer.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string into a buffer `dest` of size `destlen`. However, it then proceeds to modify the contents of `dest` using `memmove` without re-evaluating the buffer boundaries. If the original `snprintf` call created a string that, when modified by `memmove`, exceeds `destlen`, a buffer overflow will occur. Specifically, `memmove` copies from `last` to `first`, potentially overwriting data beyond the allocated size of `dest`."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from one buffer to another without checking the size of the input, which could lead to a buffer overflow.","The `memmove` function is used to overwrite part of the `dest` buffer, but the code does not check if the source and destination regions overlap in a way that could lead to data corruption or a buffer overflow. Specifically, if `last` is close to the beginning of `dest` and `first` is near the end, `memmove` could write beyond the bounds of `dest`."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from one buffer to another without checking the size of the input, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string into a buffer `dest` of size `destlen`. However, it then proceeds to modify the contents of `dest` using `memmove` without re-evaluating the buffer size. If the `memmove` operation shifts data beyond the bounds of `dest`, a buffer overflow can occur. Specifically, if `last` is close to the beginning of `dest` and `strlen(last)` is large, the `memmove` could write past the end of the buffer."
