"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-memory (OOM)","The software does not properly handle exhaustion of system resources, such as memory. This can lead to a denial of service or unexpected behavior.","The code uses `inflate` in a loop with `Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH`. A malicious input can cause the `inflate` function to allocate excessive memory, leading to a denial of service. The `avail_out` is set to `buf_size`, which is determined by `av_bprint_get_buffer`. If a crafted input causes `inflate` to require more memory than `buf_size`, it will return `Z_OK` but not fully process the input, leading to an infinite loop or excessive memory consumption."
