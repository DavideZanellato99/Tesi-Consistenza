"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data to a buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code uses `r_strbuf_setf` and `r_strbuf_set` to construct ESIL strings based on input data without proper length validation. Specifically, the `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern1`, `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern2`, and `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern3` functions likely copy data from the `data` buffer into the `addrbuf` buffer. If the data in `data` is crafted to be larger than `buffsize - 1`, a buffer overflow will occur in `addrbuf`, leading to potential code execution."
