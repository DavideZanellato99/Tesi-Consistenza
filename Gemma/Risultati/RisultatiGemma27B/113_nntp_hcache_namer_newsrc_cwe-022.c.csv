"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate or handle the length of input data, leading to an overflow of a buffer.","The snprintf function is used to format a string into a destination buffer. If the formatted string exceeds the size of the destination buffer (destlen), a buffer overflow can occur, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. The path variable is user-controlled and can be crafted to cause a long string after formatting, resulting in a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies a source buffer into a destination buffer without checking the size of the input, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The snprintf function is used to format a string into a destination buffer. If the formatted string exceeds the size of the destination buffer (destlen), a buffer overflow can occur, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. The path variable is user-controlled and can be crafted to cause a long string after formatting, resulting in a buffer overflow."
