"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code calculates `pos` using modulo arithmetic with `%4`. This can result in `pos` being 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, the code then accesses `data[pos + 4]` and `data[pos + 8]` without checking if `pos + 4` or `pos + 8` are within the bounds of the `data` buffer. If `pos` is 4, then `pos + 4` becomes 8 and `pos + 8` becomes 12, which could be out of bounds depending on the value of `len`. This leads to a potential out-of-bounds read."
