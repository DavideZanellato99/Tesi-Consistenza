"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the starting address `ss` for the source image data. If `early` is non-zero (specifically, if `x` is negative and `early` is set to `x >= 0`, which is true when `x` is 0 or positive, and false when `x` is negative), this subtraction can result in a pointer value that is before the beginning of the allocated memory for `src->data`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the code later accesses memory using `ss`. The check `if (src == NULL)` does not prevent this vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the starting address `ss`. If `early` is non-zero, this can result in `ss` pointing to a memory location before the beginning of the `src->data` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. The check `src == NULL` does not prevent this vulnerability."
"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory buffer. This can occur when the read index is negative or greater than or equal to the buffer size.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the starting address `ss` for the source image data. If `early` is non-zero (specifically, if `x` is negative and `early` is set to `x >= 0`, which is true when `x` is 0 or positive, and false when `x` is negative), this subtraction can result in a pointer value that is less than the base address of `src->data`. This can lead to reading from memory locations before the allocated buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read."
"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when an index or pointer is not properly validated before being used to access memory.","The code subtracts `early` from `src->data` to calculate the starting address `ss` for the source image data. If `early` is non-zero (specifically, if `x` is negative and `early` is set to `x >= 0`, which is true when `x` is 0 or positive, and false when `x` is negative), this subtraction can result in a pointer value that is less than the base address of `src->data`. This can lead to reading from memory locations before the allocated buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. The subsequent use of `ss` in the composition operations then accesses this invalid memory."
