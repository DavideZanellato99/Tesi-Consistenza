"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-memory (OOM)","The software does not properly handle errors or conditions that can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) situation. This can occur when the software attempts to allocate memory that exceeds the available resources, resulting in a crash or unexpected behavior.","The code uses `realloc` to resize buffers (`iconInfo->bitsMask`, `iconInfo->colorTable`, `iconInfo->bitsColor`) based on values read from the stream (`iconInfo->cbBitsMask`, `iconInfo->cbColorTable`, `iconInfo->cbBitsColor`). If a malicious stream provides a very large value for these sizes, `realloc` could allocate a huge amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting system resources. There is no check to limit the maximum size of these allocations."
