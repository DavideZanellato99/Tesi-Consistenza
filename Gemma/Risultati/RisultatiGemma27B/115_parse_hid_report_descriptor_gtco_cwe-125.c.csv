"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the code does not properly validate the size of the data being read, or when the buffer is not large enough to hold the data.","The code reads data from a report buffer (`report`) based on the `size` variable, which is derived from the `prefix` value. However, the code does not adequately validate the `size` variable against the remaining length of the `report` buffer. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when `i + size` exceeds the `length` of the report, potentially causing a crash or information disclosure. Specifically, the `get_unaligned_le16` and `get_unaligned_le32` functions are called without checking if there are enough bytes remaining in the buffer."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash, information leak, or arbitrary code execution.","The code reads data from a report buffer (`report`) based on the `size` variable, which is derived from the `prefix` byte. However, the code does not adequately validate the `size` variable before using it to read data from the `report` buffer. Specifically, the `switch` statement handles sizes 1, 2, and 3, but if `PREF_SIZE(prefix)` returns a value greater than 3, the code will proceed to `i += size` without reading any data, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read in subsequent iterations if `size` is large enough to cause `i` to exceed the `length` of the report."
