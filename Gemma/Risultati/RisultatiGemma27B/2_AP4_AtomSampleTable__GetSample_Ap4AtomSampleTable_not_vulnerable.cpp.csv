"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate integer arithmetic, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the software to behave in unexpected ways, such as crashing or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code iterates from `index-skip` to `index` to calculate the offset. If `index` is small and `skip` is large, `index - skip` can be negative. The loop `for (unsigned int i = index-skip; i < index; i++)` will then wrap around to a very large value due to the unsigned integer type, leading to a large number of iterations and potentially an integer overflow when `offset += size` is executed. This can result in an incorrect offset being calculated, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access when the sample data is read."
