"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer before performing an operation that could result in an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations, buffer overflows, or denial of service.","The code iterates through interfaces based on values in the `assoc->bInterfaceCount` and `assoc->bFirstInterface` fields. If these values are maliciously crafted (e.g., `bInterfaceCount` is very large and `bFirstInterface` is small), the loop could iterate through a large number of interfaces, potentially accessing memory outside the valid range of interfaces, leading to a denial of service or potentially information disclosure. This is an integer overflow/out-of-bounds access vulnerability."
