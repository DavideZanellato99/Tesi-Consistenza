"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Over-Read","The software reads data from a buffer but does not check whether the read is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to reading data outside the buffer, which can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.","The code copies data from `old[i].ext` to `result[i].ext` using `lys_ext_dup`. The `lys_ext_dup` function takes `old[i].ext_size` as an argument, which determines the amount of data to copy. However, the code does not validate `old[i].ext_size` before using it. If `old[i].ext_size` is larger than the actual size of the data pointed to by `old[i].ext`, a buffer overflow can occur in `lys_ext_dup` when copying the data."
