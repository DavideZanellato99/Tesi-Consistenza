"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The code copies data from a source buffer into a destination buffer without checking the size of the source buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code copies data from user-provided `p->fname` into `priv->ctrl.fname` using `kstrdup`. While `kstrdup` allocates memory, there's no check on the length of `p->fname` before copying, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow if `p->fname` is excessively long. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution."
