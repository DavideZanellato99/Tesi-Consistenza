"1","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","The code accesses memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to crashes, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates through a list of TCP connections and calls `sk->sk_prot->disconnect(sk, 0)` and `tcp_done(sk)` on each socket. If `tcp_done` is called on a socket that is already being disconnected or has been closed, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. The double-free can occur if the socket is disconnected in another context before `tcp_done` is called in this function."

"5","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","The software accesses memory after it has been freed. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.","The code iterates through a list of TCP connections and calls `sk->sk_prot->disconnect(sk, 0)` and `tcp_done(sk)` on each socket. If `tcp_done` is called on a socket that is already being disconnected or has been closed, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. The double-free vulnerability arises because `rds_conn_destroy` might be called on the same connection from multiple threads or contexts, leading to a double free of the connection data."
