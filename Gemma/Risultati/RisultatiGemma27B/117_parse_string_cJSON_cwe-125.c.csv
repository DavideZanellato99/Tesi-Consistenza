"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing an array with an index that is too large or too small, or when dereferencing a pointer that points to an invalid memory location.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the UTF-8 decoding logic within the `case 'u'` block. Specifically, the code attempts to handle UTF-16 surrogate pairs, but it doesn't properly validate the input string length before accessing `ptr[1]` and `ptr[2]`. If the input string ends prematurely after the first `\u`, the code will read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution."
