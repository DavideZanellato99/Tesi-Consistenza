"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The software does not limit the consumption of a resource (e.g., memory, CPU time, network bandwidth, disk space, file handles, etc.) and an attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by exhausting the resource.","The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to unbounded queue growth and potential memory exhaustion. While the `m_peers.pop_front()` attempts to limit the size of the `m_peers` vector to `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES`, if `newLogPeer` signal emission takes a significant amount of time or if the signal handler itself is slow or causes blocking operations, the `m_peers` vector can continue to grow before `pop_front()` is called.  A malicious actor could rapidly generate log entries, causing the vector to consume excessive memory, leading to a crash or performance degradation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the `peerCounter++` is not protected by the lock, potentially leading to integer overflow if the system runs for a very long time."
