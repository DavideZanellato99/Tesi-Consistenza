"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory buffer. This can occur when the read index is negative, greater than or equal to the buffer size, or when the size of the read exceeds the buffer size.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. However, inside the loop, it accesses `&data[i]` and compares it with `header` using `memcmp`. If `header_size` is greater than 0, and `i` reaches `data_size - header_size`, then `&data[i]` will point to a memory location near the end of the `data` buffer.  If `header_size` is large enough, `&data[i] + header_size` could go beyond the bounds of `data`, leading to a read-out-of-bounds when `memcmp` attempts to read `header_size` bytes starting from `&data[i]`. This is especially problematic if `data_size` is small and `header_size` is relatively large."

"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory buffer. This can occur when the read index is negative, greater than or equal to the buffer size, or when the buffer size is not properly validated.","The code iterates through `data` up to `data_size - header_size`. However, inside the loop, it accesses `&data[i]` and compares it with `header` using `memcmp`. If `header_size` is greater than 0, and `i` reaches `data_size - header_size`, then `&data[i]` will point to a memory location very close to the end of the allocated `data` buffer.  If `i` becomes equal to `data_size - header_size`, then `&data[i]` will point to `data_size`, and `&data[i] + header_size` will read beyond the bounds of the `data` buffer.
