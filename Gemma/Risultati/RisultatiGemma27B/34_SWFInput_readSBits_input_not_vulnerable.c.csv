"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly handle the potential for integer underflow when subtracting a large power of 2 from a smaller integer.","The code subtracts 2^number from num when the most significant bit of num is set, but only if number is non-zero. If number is large enough, num - (1<<number) can result in integer underflow, leading to a large positive value being returned instead of a negative one. This can cause unexpected behavior or security issues depending on how the return value is used."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the result of a subtraction operation, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the program to behave in unexpected ways, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.","The code subtracts 2^number from num when the most significant bit of num is set, but only if number is non-zero. If number is large enough, num - (1<<number) can result in integer overflow, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior."
