"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates through a fixed-size array `usb_chip` (SNDRV_CARDS) to find an available slot for a new USB audio device. If no slot is found, it returns an error. However, there is no check to prevent exceeding the bounds of the `usb_chip` array, potentially leading to a write-out-of-bounds if SNDRV_CARDS is large and the system is repeatedly probed with new USB audio devices."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an array. This can lead to a crash, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates through a fixed-size array `usb_chip` (SNDRV_CARDS) to find an available slot for a new USB audio device. If no slot is found, it returns an error. However, there is no check to prevent exceeding the bounds of the `usb_chip` array, potentially leading to a write-after-free or out-of-bounds write if SNDRV_CARDS is large and the system is under memory pressure. The loop continues until `i` reaches `SNDRV_CARDS`, and the code accesses `usb_chip[i]` without verifying that `i` is within the array bounds."
