"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the results of an integer operation, leading to an overflow or wraparound. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or out-of-bounds access.","The code subtracts `buf_size` from `dctx->remaining` without checking if `buf_size` is larger than `dctx->remaining`. This can lead to an integer underflow, resulting in a large positive value for `dctx->remaining`. Subsequently, the condition `buf_size - i + 47 >= dctx->remaining` can become true even when it shouldn't be, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads or other unexpected behavior."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of data before performing operations on it, leading to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as memory corruption or denial of service.","The code calculates `dctx->remaining` based on `cid` using `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` and `dnxhd_get_hr_frame_size`. If both return non-positive values, the function returns `dctx->remaining` directly. However, `dctx->remaining` is initialized to 0 and can be modified to negative values in the `else` block within the `if (buf_size - i + 47 >= dctx->remaining)` condition. Returning a negative value for frame size can lead to integer underflow or other unexpected behavior in calling functions."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the results of calculations, potentially leading to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as incorrect frame size calculations and potential vulnerabilities.","The code calculates `dctx->remaining` based on `cid` using `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` and `dnxhd_get_hr_frame_size`. If both return non-positive values, the function returns `dctx->remaining` directly. However, `dctx->remaining` is initialized to 0 and can be modified to negative values in the `else` block within the `pic_found && !dctx->remaining` condition. Returning a negative value for frame size can lead to integer underflow or other unexpected behavior in calling functions."
"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The code does not properly validate the results of calculations, potentially leading to integer overflow or wraparound. Specifically, `dctx->remaining` can become negative, and this negative value is returned, which could be misinterpreted as a valid frame size.","The code calculates `dctx->remaining` based on `cid` using `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` and `dnxhd_get_hr_frame_size`.
