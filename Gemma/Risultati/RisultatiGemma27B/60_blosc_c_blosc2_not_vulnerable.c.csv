"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `get_run` function. The `get_run` function accesses `_src[j * neblock]` without checking if `j * neblock` is within the bounds of `_src`. If `j` is large enough and `neblock` is also large, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read."
