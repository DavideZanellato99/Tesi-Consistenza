"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing an array with an index that is too large or too small, or when reading a string without checking its length.","The code does not check the size of `object->list.objects[0]->sector` before passing it to `r_asn1_stringify_oid`. If `object->list.objects[0]->sector` is excessively large, `r_asn1_stringify_oid` could attempt to allocate a large amount of memory, leading to a heap overflow."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing an array with an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the array's size, or when dereferencing a pointer that points to a memory location outside the allocated region.","The code does not check the size of `object->list.objects[0]->sector` before passing it to `r_asn1_stringify_oid`. If `object->list.objects[0]->sector` points to a buffer that is too small, `r_asn1_stringify_oid` could write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region.

If `object->list.objects[0]->sector` points to a buffer larger than expected, `r_asn1_stringify_oid` could read beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer over-read."
