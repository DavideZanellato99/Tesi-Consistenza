"1","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software constructs a web page using data from an untrusted source without properly neutralizing or escaping the data. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser.","The code uses `Utils::String::toHtmlEscaped` only on the peer client string, but other data from the `peer` object (like IP, country name, flags description, downloading piece names) are directly inserted into the `QStandardItem` model without proper sanitization. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the data is later displayed in a web view or other context that interprets HTML."
