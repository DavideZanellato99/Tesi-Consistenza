"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `floppy_sizes[cnt] = floppy_sizes[cnt + 0x80] = floppy_type[type].size + 1;` within a loop where `type` is user-controlled. If `type` is sufficiently large, `type << 2` and `(type << 2) + 4` can result in out-of-bounds writes to the `floppy_sizes` array."
