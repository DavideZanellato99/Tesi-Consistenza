"1","True","CWE-287","Improper Authentication","The software does not properly validate the identity of a user or process before granting access to resources. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential security breaches. In this case, the failure to properly handle the import of the hash state after accepting a new connection can lead to an inconsistent state and potential vulnerabilities.","The code exports the hash state using crypto_ahash_export and then imports it into a new socket's context using crypto_ahash_import. If the crypto_ahash_export fails, the error is returned. However, if af_alg_accept succeeds but crypto_ahash_import fails, the new socket is orphaned and its reference count decremented, but the error from crypto_ahash_import is returned, potentially leading to a resource leak or denial of service. The code does not handle the case where crypto_ahash_import fails after af_alg_accept succeeds, leaving the new socket in an inconsistent state."
"2","True","CWE-754","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The software does not handle exceptional conditions (e.g., errors) correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code exports the hash state using crypto_ahash_export and then imports it into a new socket's context using crypto_ahash_import.

"3","True","CWE-281","Improper Error Handling","The software does not handle errors that occur during function execution. This can result in unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code exports the hash state using crypto_ahash_export and then imports it into a new socket's context using crypto_ahash_import. If the crypto_ahash_export fails, the error is returned. However, if af_alg_accept succeeds but crypto_ahash_import fails, the new socket is orphaned and its reference count decremented, but the error from crypto_ahash_import is returned, potentially leading to a resource leak or denial of service if the error handling is not robust enough in the calling function. The code does not properly handle the case where the import fails after the accept succeeds, potentially leaving the new socket in an inconsistent state."
