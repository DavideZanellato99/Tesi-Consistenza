"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing arrays with invalid indices, or when dereferencing pointers that point to memory outside the allocated region.","The code contains a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the nested `while` loops within the `if (s1 && (s2->linebreak == 1))` block. Specifically, the loop `--w` can decrement `w` beyond the bounds of the `text_info->glyphs` array if `s1` is close to the beginning of the array. This can lead to reading or writing to invalid memory locations."
