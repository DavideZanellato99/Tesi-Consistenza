"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer before performing an operation that could lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as memory corruption or denial of service.","The code reads a length `reasonLen` from the server and allocates a buffer `reason` of size `reasonLen + 1`. However, `reasonLen` is an unsigned 32-bit integer. If the server sends a very large value for `reasonLen` (close to the maximum value of a uint32_t), the `malloc` call could result in integer overflow when cast to `uint64_t`, leading to a smaller-than-expected buffer allocation. Subsequently, the `ReadFromRFBServer` function attempts to write `reasonLen` bytes into this smaller buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow."
