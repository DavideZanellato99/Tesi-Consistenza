"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies data into a buffer without verifying that the size of the input data is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and execute arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `FORM_INPUT_TEXT`, `FORM_INPUT_FILE`, `FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD`, and `FORM_TEXTAREA` cases. Specifically, the `form_update_line` function (not provided in the snippet but called within) likely writes data pointed to by `p` (form->value->ptr) into the buffer `l->lineBuf` without proper bounds checking. The loop iterates based on `rows` and potentially writes beyond the allocated size of `l->lineBuf`, leading to a heap buffer overflow. The `shiftAnchorPosition` calls further exacerbate the risk as they operate on potentially corrupted data."

The `spos` and `epos` variables, derived from the `Anchor` structure, are used to define the write region. If the values of `spos` and `epos` are not carefully validated against the length of `l->lineBuf`, a write beyond the buffer's boundaries can occur, leading to a heap buffer overflow. The `shiftAnchorPosition` calls further indicate potential manipulation of data structures that could be affected by the overflow."
