"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The software consumes an excessive amount of a limited resource (e.g., memory, CPU time, network bandwidth) without restraint. This can lead to denial of service or other undesirable effects. In this case, the resource is the memory used by the signal/slot connections and the processing done by the connected slots.","The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to unbounded queue growth and subsequent memory exhaustion. While the `m_messages.pop_front()` attempts to limit the queue size to `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES`, the `emit newLogMessage(temp)` call *before* the size check can trigger signals to connected slots. If these slots perform operations that take a significant amount of time or allocate memory, and the signal is emitted rapidly (e.g., by a malicious actor flooding the logger with messages), it can lead to a backlog of unprocessed signals and potentially exhaust system resources, causing a DoS. The `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES` limit only applies to the internal queue, not to the number of signals emitted."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The software does not limit or incorrectly limits the resources used when processing data.

"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The software consumes excessive resources, such as CPU time, memory, or network bandwidth, leading to denial of service or system instability.","The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to unbounded queue growth and subsequent memory exhaustion. While the `m_messages.pop_front()` attempts to limit the queue size to `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES`, the `emit newLogMessage(temp)` call *before* the size check can trigger signals to connected slots. If these slots perform operations that take significant time or allocate memory, a malicious actor could rapidly fill the queue with messages, causing the signal emission to overwhelm the system with processing requests before the queue can be trimmed. This can lead to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. The `Utils::String::toHtmlEscaped(message)` function could also be a source of vulnerability if it has its own buffer overflow issues, but the primary concern here is the signal emission before queue size limiting."
