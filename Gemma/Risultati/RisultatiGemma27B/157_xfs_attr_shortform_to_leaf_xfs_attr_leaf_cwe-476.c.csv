"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate the size of input data, leading to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution.","The code copies data from `ifp->if_u1.if_data` to `tmpbuffer` using `memcpy(tmpbuffer, ifp->if_u1.if_data, size)`. The `size` variable is read from `sf->hdr.totsize` which is a 16-bit value converted to CPU using `be16_to_cpu`. If `sf->hdr.totsize` is crafted maliciously, it could lead to a heap buffer overflow in `tmpbuffer` because the size is not validated against the allocated size of `tmpbuffer`."
