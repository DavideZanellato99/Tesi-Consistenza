"1","True","CWE-134","Format String Vulnerability","The software does not neutralize format string specifiers in a string passed to a format string function. This allows an attacker to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `snprintf` calls within the `switch` statement. Specifically, the `format` variable, which is populated from the log format string, is used directly in `snprintf` without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious log format string containing format specifiers (e.g., %s, %x, %n) that would allow them to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations."
