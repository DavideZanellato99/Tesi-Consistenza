"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from a source buffer into a destination buffer without checking the size of the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the destination buffer.","The code copies `d->msg_len` bytes from `d->msg` into `state->dsec_cmd.args`. However, the size of `state->dsec_cmd.args` is not checked against `d->msg_len`, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if `d->msg_len` is large enough. Although there is a check `if (d->msg_len > sizeof(d->msg))`, this only validates the length against the source buffer `d->msg`, not the destination buffer `state->dsec_cmd.args`."
