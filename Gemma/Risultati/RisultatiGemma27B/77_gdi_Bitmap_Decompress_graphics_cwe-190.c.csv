"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Destination Buffer Length","The code copies data from a source buffer into a destination buffer without verifying that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the bounds of the destination buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code calculates `dstSize` as `SrcSize * dbpp / sbpp`. If `SrcSize` is sufficiently large and `dbpp` is greater than `sbpp`, the multiplication `SrcSize * dbpp` can result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller value for `dstSize` than expected. The subsequent check `if (dstSize < bitmap->length)` might then incorrectly pass, allowing `freerdp_image_copy` to write beyond the allocated buffer `bitmap->data`, resulting in a buffer overflow."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the results of integer operations, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound.
