"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies a data block into a buffer without checking the size of the input data, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.","The function `ResolveStateAndPredicate` uses `xkb_atom_text` to retrieve strings from an XKB context based on identifiers. These strings are then used in `LookupString` without any length validation. If a malicious XKB configuration contains an identifier with a very long string, `xkb_atom_text` could return a pointer to a buffer that, when copied by `LookupString`, leads to a buffer overflow."
