"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies a block of data to a buffer without verifying that the size of the data does not exceed the capacity of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code modifies the input string `str` by inserting null terminators at the positions of ':' and '=' characters using pointer arithmetic (`*flags++ = '\0'`, `*nodelist++ = '\0'`). If the input string `str` is not properly null-terminated, or if the positions of ':' or '=' are close to the end of the allocated buffer for `str`, this can lead to a heap buffer overflow. The code then uses the modified string for further processing, potentially reading beyond the intended boundaries."
