"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from one buffer to another without checking the size of the input, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The code uses `inflate` in a loop with `Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH`. A malicious input can cause the `inflate` function to write beyond the allocated buffer `buf` due to insufficient bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. The `buf_size - 1` calculation attempts to reserve space for a null terminator, but doesn't prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer if the decompressed data is large."
