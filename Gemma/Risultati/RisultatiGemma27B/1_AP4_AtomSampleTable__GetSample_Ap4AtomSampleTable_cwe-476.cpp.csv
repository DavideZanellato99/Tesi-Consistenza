"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate integer arithmetic, which can lead to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause the software to behave in unexpected ways, such as crashing or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code iterates from `index-skip` to `index` to calculate the offset. If `index` is very large and `skip` is also large, `index - skip` could potentially underflow, resulting in a very large positive value. This large value would then be used as the starting point for the loop, leading to a very large number of iterations. This can cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU time."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The software does not properly validate the size of an integer before performing an arithmetic operation, leading to an overflow or wraparound. This can cause the program to behave in unexpected ways, such as crashing or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code iterates from `index-skip` to `index` to calculate the offset. If `index` is very large and `skip` is also large, `index - skip` could potentially be negative. The loop `for (unsigned int i = index-skip; i < index; i++)` will then wrap around to a very large positive number, leading to a very large number of iterations and potentially an integer overflow when `offset += size` is executed repeatedly. This could lead to a large offset value, potentially causing a read beyond the bounds of the sample stream when the offset is used to access data."
