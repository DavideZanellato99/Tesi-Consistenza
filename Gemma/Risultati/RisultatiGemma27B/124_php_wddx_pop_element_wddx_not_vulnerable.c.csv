"1","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Proper Release","The software allocates resources (e.g., memory, file handles) but does not properly release them when they are no longer needed. This can lead to resource exhaustion, which can cause the software to crash or become unresponsive.","The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of `php_base64_decode` without proper length validation. If a very large base64 encoded string is provided, `php_base64_decode` could allocate a significant amount of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a crash."
