"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when accessing an array with an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the array's size.","The code does not check if `*begin` or `*end` are within the bounds of the input string `str` before accessing `str[*begin]` or `str[*end]`. This can lead to a read-out-of-bounds vulnerability if `*begin` or `*end` are greater than or equal to the length of `str`. Specifically, the `while` loops increment `*begin` and `*end` without checking if they exceed the string length, potentially causing a crash or information leak."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code does not check if `*begin` or `*end` are within the bounds of the input string `str` before accessing `str[*begin]` or `str[*end]`. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads, especially in the `while` loops. The initial check `*begin > strlen(str)` only covers the case where `*begin` is already out of bounds at the function call, but not during the increment operations within the loops."
