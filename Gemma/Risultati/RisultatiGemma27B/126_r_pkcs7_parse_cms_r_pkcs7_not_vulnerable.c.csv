"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from a source buffer into a destination buffer without checking the size of the source data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source data is larger than the destination buffer.","The code does not check the length of the `contentType` string created by `r_asn1_stringify_oid`. If the OID is very long, it could lead to a buffer overflow when copying the string into `container->contentType`."
