"1","True","CWE-59","Improper Link Resolution","The software does not properly resolve symbolic links, which can allow an attacker to trick the software into operating on a different file than intended.","The code uses `SystemUtilities::oopen(path)` which likely returns a file descriptor. If `path` is crafted maliciously (e.g., contains symbolic links), `SystemUtilities::oopen` could open a different file than intended, leading to arbitrary file read/write.
