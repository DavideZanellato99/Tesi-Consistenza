"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The application consumes an excessive amount of a resource, such as CPU time, memory, or network bandwidth, leading to a denial-of-service or system crash.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `size` number of `lys_restr` structures. However, the loop iterates `size` times and populates each element of the allocated array. If `size` is very large, the repeated calls to `lydict_insert` within the loop could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if the dictionary insertion operations are expensive or consume excessive resources. This is because the complexity of `lydict_insert` is not considered in relation to the size of the input."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The software does not limit or incorrectly limits the resources used during processing. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `size` number of `lys_restr` structures. However, the loop iterates `size` times and populates each element of the allocated array. If `size` is very large, the repeated calls to `lydict_insert` within the loop could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if these functions have unbounded complexity or allocate significant resources for each insertion, especially if the input data for insertion is attacker-controlled. This could exhaust system resources."
"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region.","The code copies data from `old` to `result` without checking if `size` is within the bounds of the `old` array. If `size` is greater than the actual size of the `old` array, it will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."
"4","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The software does not limit or incorrectly limits the resources used during processing. This can lead to excessive consumption of CPU time, memory, or other resources, potentially causing a denial-of-service or system crash.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `size` number of `lys_restr` structures. However, the loop iterates `size` times and populates each element of the allocated array. If `size` is very large, the repeated calls to `lydict_insert` within the loop could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if the dictionary insertion operations are resource-intensive or have unbounded complexity. This could exhaust system resources, causing the application to become unresponsive."
"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region.","The code copies data from `old` to `result` without checking if `size` is within the bounds of the `old` array.
