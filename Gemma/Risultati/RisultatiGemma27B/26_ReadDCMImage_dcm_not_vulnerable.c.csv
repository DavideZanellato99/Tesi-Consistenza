"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-memory (OOM)","The software does not properly handle situations where it runs out of memory. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or denial of service.","The code reads data from a DICOM file without proper bounds checking, specifically in the loop where it reads data into `data` using `ReadBlob`. If the DICOM file is crafted maliciously with a large `datum` value, the `length` calculation (`length = (size_t) datum / quantum`) could result in a very large value. Subsequently, `AcquireQuantumMemory(length + 1, quantum * sizeof(*data))` could lead to a large memory allocation, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) via memory exhaustion."
