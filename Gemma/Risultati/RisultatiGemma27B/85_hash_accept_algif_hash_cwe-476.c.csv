"1","True","CWE-345","State Transfer Vulnerability","The software does not properly manage the transfer of state information, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. This can occur when state is transferred between components or processes without proper validation or synchronization.","The code exports the hash state from the parent socket and imports it into the child socket after accepting a connection. However, there is no synchronization or validation between the export and import operations. A malicious client could potentially manipulate the exported state, leading to a crafted state being imported into the server, potentially bypassing security checks or causing denial of service. This is a form of state transfer vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-345","State Transfer Vulnerability","The software does not properly manage the transfer of state information, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code exports the hash state from the parent socket and imports it into the child socket after accepting a connection. However, there is no synchronization or validation between the export and import operations. A malicious client could potentially manipulate the exported state before it is imported, leading to a denial-of-service or potentially allowing the client to influence the hash calculation in the server. This is a form of state transfer vulnerability."

"5","True","CWE-345","State Manipulation","The software does not properly manage the state of a cryptographic operation, allowing an attacker to manipulate the state and potentially compromise the security of the operation.","The code exports the hash state from the parent socket and imports it into the child socket after accepting a connection. However, there is no synchronization or validation between the export and import operations. A malicious client could potentially manipulate the exported state before it is imported, leading to a denial-of-service or potentially allowing the client to influence the hash calculation in the server. Specifically, the `crypto_ahash_import` function could be vulnerable to state collision attacks if the exported state is tampered with."
