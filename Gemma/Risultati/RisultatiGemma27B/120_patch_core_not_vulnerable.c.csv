"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated memory region. This can occur when accessing arrays, strings, or other data structures using an index or offset that is outside the valid range.","The code copies data from `diffPtr` and `extraPtr` into `newData` based on sizes provided in the `controlTuples`. However, the code then adds the values from `origData` to the copied data in `newData` without checking if `oldpos + j` is within the bounds of `origData`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read from `origData` if `oldpos + j` exceeds `origDataLength`."
