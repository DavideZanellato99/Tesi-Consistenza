"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate a pathname to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or modification of system files.","The code attempts to sanitize file paths extracted from a zip archive to prevent directory traversal attacks. However, the sanitization logic is flawed. Specifically, the repeated replacement of ""/../"" with ""/"" does not fully prevent traversal. An attacker could craft a zip entry with a path like ""/.././.././../etc/passwd"", which, after the replacements, would still resolve to a path outside the intended destination directory. The code also checks for backslashes but replaces them with forward slashes, which doesn't fully address the issue on Windows systems."
