"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data from a buffer but does not check whether the read is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to information disclosure or other security vulnerabilities.","The code reads data from a file using `ReadBlob` and uses the returned size to calculate offsets and allocate memory. The `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` value, read from the file, is used in calculations like `(MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image)`. If `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is maliciously crafted to be very large, adding `filepos` could result in an integer overflow, leading to a value smaller than `filepos`. This smaller value would then be compared to `GetBlobSize(image)`, potentially bypassing the check and allowing `ReadBlob` to read beyond the end of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the software does not properly validate the size of the data being read, or when the software uses an incorrect index to access the buffer.","The code reads data from a file using `ReadBlob` and uses the returned size to calculate offsets and allocate memory. However, the code does not adequately validate the size returned by `ReadBlob` against the expected size, potentially leading to an integer overflow or an out-of-bounds read/write if the file contains maliciously crafted data. Specifically, the line `if((MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image))` checks if the calculated offset exceeds the blob size, but it doesn't prevent `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` from being excessively large in the first place, which could cause an overflow when added to `filepos`."
