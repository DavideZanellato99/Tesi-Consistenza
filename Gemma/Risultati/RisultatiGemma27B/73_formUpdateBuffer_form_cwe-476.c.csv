"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies data into a buffer without verifying that the size of the input data is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `FORM_INPUT_TEXT`, `FORM_INPUT_FILE`, `FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD`, and `FORM_TEXTAREA` cases. Specifically, the `form_update_line` function (not provided in the snippet but called within) likely writes data pointed to by `p` (form->value->ptr) into the buffer `l->lineBuf` without proper bounds checking. The loop iterates based on `rows` and potentially writes beyond the allocated size of `l->lineBuf`, leading to a heap overflow. The `shiftAnchorPosition` calls further exacerbate the risk as they operate on potentially corrupted data."
