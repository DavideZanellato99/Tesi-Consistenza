"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The code copies data from one buffer into another without checking the size of the input, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.","The code uses `sscanf` to read six integers from the input string `str` without any length validation. If the input string does not contain six integers or contains more than six integers, `sscanf` might write beyond the bounds of the `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` variables, leading to a stack buffer overflow."
