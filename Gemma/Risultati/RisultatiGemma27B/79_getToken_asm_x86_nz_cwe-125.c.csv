"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from an array or buffer without verifying that the read is within the valid bounds of the array or buffer.","The code increments `*begin` and `*end` without checking if the resulting values exceed the bounds of the input string `str`. This can lead to a read beyond buffer boundaries, especially in the `while` loops."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can occur when the code does not properly validate the size of the data being read, or when the code uses an incorrect index to access the buffer.","The code increments `*begin` and `*end` without checking if the resulting values exceed the bounds of the input string `str`. This can lead to a read beyond the buffer, potentially causing a crash or information leak. Specifically, the `while` loops `while (begin && isspace ((ut8)str[*begin]))` and `while (end && isalnum ((ut8)str[*end]))` increment the pointers without bounds checking."
