"1","True","CWE-127","Buffer Overflow","The software does not properly validate the size of the input data, leading to a buffer overflow when writing data to a fixed-size buffer.","The code uses `av_fast_padded_malloc` to allocate memory for `s->data` based on `avpkt->size`. However, `avpkt->size` is directly taken from the input packet without proper validation against potential integer overflows. A maliciously crafted packet with a very large `avpkt->size` could lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a small allocation size and a subsequent buffer overflow when the data from `avpkt->data` is copied into `s->data`. This is further exacerbated by the `bswap_buf` function which operates on the allocated buffer."
