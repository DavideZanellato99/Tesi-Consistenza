"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, and security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential race condition. The `hv_enabled` variable is determined based on `kvmppc_hv_ops` and `is_kvmppc_hv_enabled(kvm)`. However, `kvmppc_hv_ops` and the state of the HV module can change between the initial check and the subsequent use of `hv_enabled`. This can lead to incorrect decisions being made based on an outdated value of `hv_enabled`, potentially causing incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","A potential integer overflow can occur when calculating `threads_per_subcore` and using it in subsequent calculations, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential race condition.
