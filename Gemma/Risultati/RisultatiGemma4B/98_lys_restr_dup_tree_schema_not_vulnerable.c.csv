"1","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A heap buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated memory boundary for a heap-allocated buffer. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `result`, but it doesn't check if `size` is zero. If `size` is zero, `calloc` returns `NULL`, which is then used in the subsequent `LY_CHECK_ERR_RETURN` call. However, the code doesn't handle the case where `calloc` returns `NULL` correctly, potentially leading to a crash or undefined behavior if the caller attempts to use the returned pointer."
