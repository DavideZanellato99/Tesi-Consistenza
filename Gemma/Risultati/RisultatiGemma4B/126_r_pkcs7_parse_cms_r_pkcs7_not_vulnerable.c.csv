"1","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A heap buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the bounds of a buffer allocated on the heap.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `r_asn1_create_object` function is called with `buffer` and `length`. If `length` is larger than the actual data in `buffer`, `r_asn1_create_object` might write beyond the allocated memory for `object->list.objects`. The subsequent checks `object->list.length != 2` and `object->list.objects[1]->list.length != 1` do not guarantee that the buffer is within bounds, as they only check the length of the list, not the size of the individual objects within the list.  The `r_asn1_stringify_oid` function could also lead to a buffer overflow if the `sector` data is larger than expected."
