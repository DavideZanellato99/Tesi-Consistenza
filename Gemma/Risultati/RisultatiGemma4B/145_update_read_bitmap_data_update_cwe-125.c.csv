"1","True","CWE-119","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is greater than the allocated size of `bitmapData->bitmapDataStream`. The `malloc` function allocates memory, but if `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is larger than the available memory, `malloc` may return NULL, leading to a crash.  The `memcpy` operation will write beyond the bounds of `bitmapData->bitmapDataStream` if the allocated size is insufficient."
