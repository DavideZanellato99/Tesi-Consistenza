"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow attackers to gain control of the system.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `rest_bytes`. Specifically, `rest_bytes = (void *)(host_iface->extra + host_iface->extralen) - control_header;` could overflow if `host_iface->extra + host_iface->extralen` is larger than the address of `control_header`. This could lead to a heap overflow or other memory corruption issues."
