"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper integer conversion or arithmetic. An integer variable or expression is used in a context where it is not intended to be used, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `rds_rdma_cookie_offset` calculation. The `args->cookie` field is an integer, and its offset is added to `args->remote_addr`. If `args->cookie` is large, the result of the addition could overflow, leading to an incorrect `args->remote_addr` value. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access in subsequent operations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper integer conversion or arithmetic. An integer variable or expression contains values that are outside the valid range for its type.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `rds_rdma_cookie_offset` calculation. The `args->cookie` field is an integer, and its offset is added to `args->remote_addr`. If `args->cookie` is large, the result of the addition could overflow, leading to an incorrect `args->remote_addr` value. This could be exploited to cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper manipulation of integer values during arithmetic or conversion operations, leading to an incorrect result.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `rds_rdma_cookie_offset` calculation.
