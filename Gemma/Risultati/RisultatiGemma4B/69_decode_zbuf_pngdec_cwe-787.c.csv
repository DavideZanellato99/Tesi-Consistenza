"1","True","CWE-120","Heap-Based Buffer Overflow","A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the bounds of a buffer allocated on the heap.","The code uses `inflate` without proper bounds checking on `zstream.next_out`. If `inflate` returns `Z_STREAM_END` before `zstream.avail_in` becomes 0, the `bp->len += zstream.next_out - buf;` line could potentially write beyond the allocated buffer `bp->str`. This is a buffer overflow vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking on Array or Buffer Size","A buffer over-read occurs when a program reads more data from a buffer than it was allocated to hold. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `inflate` without proper bounds checking on `zstream.next_out`. If `inflate` returns `Z_STREAM_END` before `zstream.avail_in` becomes 0, the `bp->len += zstream.next_out - buf;` line could potentially write beyond the allocated buffer `bp->str`."
