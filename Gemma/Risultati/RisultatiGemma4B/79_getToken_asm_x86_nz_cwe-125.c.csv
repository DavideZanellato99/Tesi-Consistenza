"1","True","CWE-119","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is over-read or over-written as a result of an incorrect bounds check.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while (end && isalnum ((ut8)str[*end]))` loop within the `TT_NUMBER` token recognition. If the input string contains a sequence of alphanumeric characters longer than the size of the `*end` variable, the loop will continue indefinitely, potentially leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-119","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is over-read or over-written as a result of accessing memory outside its allocated bounds.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while (end && isalnum ((ut8)str[*end]))` loop within the `TT_NUMBER` token recognition. If the input string contains a sequence of alphanumeric characters longer than the size of the `*end` variable, the loop will continue indefinitely, potentially leading to a buffer overflow."
"3","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is over-read or over-written as a result of a lack of proper bounds checking.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while (end && isalnum ((ut8)str[*end]))` loop within the `TT_NUMBER` and `TT_WORD` token recognition. If the input string contains a sequence of alphanumeric characters longer than the size of the `*end` pointer, the loop will continue incrementing `*end` beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow."
