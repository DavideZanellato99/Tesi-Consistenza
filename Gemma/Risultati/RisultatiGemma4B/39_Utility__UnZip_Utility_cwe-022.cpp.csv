"1","True","CWE-119","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability exists when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `unzGetCurrentFileInfo64` function. The `file_name` buffer is of size `MAX_PATH`, which is typically 260 characters on Windows. If the filename in the zip archive is longer than `MAX_PATH`, a buffer overflow occurs when `file_name` is copied to `qfile_name`. This could lead to arbitrary code execution."
