"1","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A type of buffer overflow that occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated memory space for a buffer on the heap.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is greater than the length read from the stream. The `memcpy` function copies `bitmapData->bitmapLength` bytes from the stream to the allocated memory. If `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is larger than the actual data in the stream, it will write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow."
