"1","True","CWE-139","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.","The code contains a format string vulnerability in the `dev_dbg` function calls. The `report` buffer is used directly in the format string without proper sanitization. If the `report` buffer contains malicious characters, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy data into `globtype` without checking for buffer overflows, which could also lead to vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-139","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper sanitization.
