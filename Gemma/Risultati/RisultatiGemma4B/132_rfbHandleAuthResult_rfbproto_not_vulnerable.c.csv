"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `rfbClientSwap32IfLE` function might not handle signed 32-bit integers correctly, leading to an overflow if `authResult` is a negative value. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that a data type can represent.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `rfbClientSwap32IfLE` function might not handle negative values correctly, leading to an integer overflow when `authResult` is a negative value. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication checks."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be stored in a variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect results, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `rfbClientSwap32IfLE` function might not handle negative values correctly, leading to an integer overflow and potentially incorrect authentication results. The `ReadReason` function is called only when the client version is 3.x and minor version is greater than 7, which is a specific condition."
