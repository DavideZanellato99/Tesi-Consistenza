"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improperly handled integer arithmetic can result in values overflowing, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `offset` calculation within the `do` loop. The `offset` is incremented by `len` in each iteration. If `len` is large, `offset` can overflow, leading to out-of-bounds access when accessing `head_skb->len`. Additionally, there's a potential for a race condition if multiple threads are modifying the skb structure concurrently."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, memory corruption, and security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `offset` calculation within the `do` loop. The `offset` is incremented by `len` in each iteration. If `len` is large, `offset` can overflow, leading to out-of-bounds access when accessing the original `head_skb`.
