"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected program behavior, including crashes, security vulnerabilities, and incorrect results.","The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `LY_TYPE_INST` case when parsing expressions. The `lyxp_parse_expr` function returns an expression structure, and the code iterates through the tokens. The `strncpy` function is used to copy tokens into the `buf` buffer. The code does not properly check the length of the tokens before copying them, which can lead to a buffer overflow if a token is longer than the `buf` buffer. Specifically, the check `if (count + (cur_expr - end) > buf_len)` only checks the length of the current token, not the total length of the string being copied."

The `lyxp_parse_expr` function returns an expression structure, and the code iterates through the tokens. The `strncpy` function is used to copy tokens into the `buf` buffer.
