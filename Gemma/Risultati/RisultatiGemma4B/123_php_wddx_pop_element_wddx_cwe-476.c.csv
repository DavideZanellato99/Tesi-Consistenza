"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `stack->top` decrement logic. If `stack->top` is already 0, the code attempts to decrement it, which is undefined behavior. Additionally, the `if (ent2->type == ST_FIELD && ent2->data == NULL)` condition could lead to a crash if `ent2` is not properly initialized. The `php_base64_decode` function is also vulnerable to buffer overflows if the input string is larger than the allocated buffer."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper integer conversion and arithmetic error during value computation or string/buffer handling.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `stack->top` decrement logic.

Additionally, the `php_base64_decode` function is vulnerable to buffer overflows if the input string is larger than the allocated buffer. The `zend_hash_merge` function can also lead to memory leaks if not handled carefully."
