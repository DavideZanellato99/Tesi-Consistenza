"1","True","CWE-119","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the `__archive_read_ahead` function. If `__archive_read_ahead` returns a pointer that is beyond the allocated buffer pointed to by `*b`, a buffer overflow occurs. The `nbytes_req` calculation and the subsequent incrementing of `*b` can lead to writing past the end of the buffer."
