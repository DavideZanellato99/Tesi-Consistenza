"1","True","CWE-22","Path Traversal","A path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended target directory by manipulating the input path.","The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is bypassed if the input path is a directory. The `SystemUtilities::getCanonicalPath` function is used to resolve symbolic links and normalize the path, but it doesn't prevent an attacker from crafting a path that includes ""../"" sequences to escape the intended directory. The `String::startsWith(b, a)` check is insufficient to prevent traversal because `getCanonicalPath` can resolve ""../"" to a path outside the intended directory."
