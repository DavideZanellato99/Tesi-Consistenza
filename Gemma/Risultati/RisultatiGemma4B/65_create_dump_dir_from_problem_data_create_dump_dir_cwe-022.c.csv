"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and denial of service attacks.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `xasprintf` function. The format string `%s-%s.%ld-%lu` is directly used to construct the `problem_id` string without any sanitization. If `type` or `iso_date_string` contains format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`), they could be exploited to read or write arbitrary memory locations."
"2","True","CWE-139","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `xasprintf` function. The format string `%s-%s.%ld-%lu` is directly used to construct the `problem_id` string, and if `type`, `iso_date_string`, or `getpid` return values contain format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`), they could be exploited to read or write arbitrary memory locations.  Specifically, `getpid()` can return a value containing format specifiers."
