"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be stored in the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `new_len` calculation within the `EL_BINARY` case. The `php_base64_decode` function can return a length greater than the original length of the input string. If `new_len` is not large enough to accommodate the decoded length, it can lead to a buffer overflow when assigning the decoded data to `Z_STRVAL_P(ent1->data)`."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type of the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `new_len` calculation within the `EL_BINARY` case. The `php_base64_decode` function can return a length greater than the original length of the input string.

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations and security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `new_len` calculation within the `EL_BINARY` case. The `php_base64_decode` function can return a length greater than the original length of the input string. If `new_len` is not large enough to accommodate the decoded length, it can lead to a buffer overflow when `new_str` is allocated. Additionally, there's a potential for a use-after-free vulnerability if `ent1` is freed before its data is used."
