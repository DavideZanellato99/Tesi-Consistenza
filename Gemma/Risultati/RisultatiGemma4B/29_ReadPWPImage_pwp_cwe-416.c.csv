"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and denial of service attacks.","The code contains a format string vulnerability in the `FormatLocaleString` function. The format string is constructed using the `next_image->filename` variable, which could be controlled by the user. If `next_image->filename` contains malicious format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%n`), they could be exploited to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to vulnerabilities such as format string bugs, buffer overflows, and SQL injection.  The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly validated before being used in a format string.","The code contains a format string vulnerability in the `FormatLocaleString` function. The format string is constructed using the `next_image->filename` variable, which could be controlled by the user. If `next_image->filename` contains malicious format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%n`), they could be interpreted by the `FormatLocaleString` function, leading to arbitrary code execution or memory corruption."
