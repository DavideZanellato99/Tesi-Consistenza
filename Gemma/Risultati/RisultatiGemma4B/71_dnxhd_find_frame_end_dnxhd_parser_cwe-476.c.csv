"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in arithmetic.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `dctx->remaining` calculation. Specifically, the line `dctx->remaining = dnxhd_get_hr_frame_size(cid, dctx->w, dctx->h);` could return a large value, potentially exceeding the maximum value that can be stored in an `int`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow could cause `dctx->remaining` to become negative, leading to incorrect frame size calculations and potentially crashing the application or leading to unexpected behavior."
