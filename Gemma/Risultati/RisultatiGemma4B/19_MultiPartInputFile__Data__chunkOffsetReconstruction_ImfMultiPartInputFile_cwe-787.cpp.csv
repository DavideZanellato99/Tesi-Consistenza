"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `chunk_start` calculation. The `chunk_start` variable is an `Int64` and is repeatedly incremented by `size_of_chunk`, which is also an `Int64`. However, `size_of_chunk` can potentially be a large value, leading to an integer overflow and an incorrect `chunk_start` value. This could cause the code to read beyond the end of the file or to access invalid memory locations. The `is.seekg(chunk_start)` call then uses this potentially incorrect `chunk_start` value, leading to further issues."
