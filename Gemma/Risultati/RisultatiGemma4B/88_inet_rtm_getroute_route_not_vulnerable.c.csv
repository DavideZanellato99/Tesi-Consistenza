"1","True","CWE-120","Improper use or handling of format strings","A format string vulnerability exists when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or memory corruption.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `fib_dump_info` function. The `fib_dump_info` function uses the format string `%p` to print the `res.fi` pointer. If `res.fi` is NULL, this will cause a crash.  The `res.fi` pointer is not checked for NULL before being passed to the format string."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper use or handling of format strings","A format string vulnerability exists when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or memory corruption.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `fib_dump_info` function. The `fib_dump_info` function uses the format string `%p` to print the `res.fi` pointer. If `res.fi` is NULL, this will cause a segmentation fault.

"3","True","CWE-120","Improper use or handling of format string","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string without proper validation. This can allow an attacker to control the format string and potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `fib_dump_info` function. The `fib_dump_info` function uses the `printf` function to format the output, and the format string is constructed using user-supplied data from the `nlmsg` structure. Specifically, the `res.fi` field, which is a pointer to a `fib_info` structure, is directly passed to `printf` without any bounds checking. If `res.fi` is NULL or points to invalid memory, `printf` may crash or exhibit undefined behavior."

"5","True","CWE-119","Improper Restriction of Reachability of a Subcomponent","A security vulnerability exists where a component is accessible in a way that is not intended. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other security issues.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `fib_dump_info` function.
