"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overread","A buffer overread occurs when a program reads data from a memory buffer beyond its allocated boundaries.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated using `(*p)[0] << 8 | (*p)[1]`, which reads two bytes from the input buffer `*p` and combines them into a size. If the input `*p` is larger than expected, this calculation can lead to reading beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy from Unsafe Source","A buffer is copied from a source that is not considered safe. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, heap overflows, and format string vulnerabilities.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated using `(*p)[0] << 8 | (*p)[1]`, which reads two bytes from the input buffer `*p` and combines them into a size. If the input `*p` is larger than expected, this calculation can lead to reading beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a crash or security vulnerability."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy from Unsafe Source","A buffer is copied from a source that is not properly validated, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated using `(*p)[0] << 8 | (*p)[1]`, which reads two bytes from the input buffer `*p` and combines them into a size. If the length of the `psk_identity_hint` is greater than the remaining buffer size, the code will attempt to read beyond the bounds of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overread","A buffer overread occurs when a program reads data from a buffer beyond its allocated size. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including information disclosure, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated using `(*p)[0] << 8 | (*p)[1]`, which reads two bytes from the input buffer `*p` and combines them into a size. If the input `*p` is larger than expected, this calculation can lead to reading beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations."
"5","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `(*p)` pointer is incremented by 2 initially, and then again by `len` (the length of the psk_identity_hint). If `len` is greater than the remaining size of the buffer pointed to by `*p` before the increment, it will write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow."
