"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `decoded_buffer_size`. Specifically, `decoded_buffer_size = 2LL * FFALIGN(blockstodecode, 8) * sizeof(*s->decoded_buffer)` can overflow if `blockstodecode` is large. The `FFALIGN` function might not prevent this overflow, leading to an incorrect buffer size and potential memory allocation errors. The `av_assert0(decoded_buffer_size <= INT_MAX)` check might not catch this overflow if `decoded_buffer_size` exceeds `INT_MAX` before the assertion is evaluated."
