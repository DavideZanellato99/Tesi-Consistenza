"1","True","CWE-129","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a pointer to a memory location is overwritten with a new address before the original address is freed. Subsequent use of the dangling pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or security breaches.","The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. `realloc` is used to resize `iconInfo->bitsMask`, `iconInfo->colorTable`, `iconInfo->bitsColor`, and `iconInfo->bitsMask`. If `realloc` fails, the original pointer is freed, and the code continues to use the freed memory. This can lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior. Additionally, the code does not check if `Stream_Read` successfully reads the data, which could lead to reading from freed memory."
"2","True","CWE-129","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a pointer to a memory location is overwritten with the address of a different memory location before the original memory location is freed. Subsequent use of the dangling pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or security breaches.","The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. `realloc` is used to resize `iconInfo->bitsMask`, `iconInfo->colorTable`, `iconInfo->bitsColor`, and `newBitMask`. If `realloc` fails, the original pointer is freed, and the code continues to use the freed memory. This can lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior when the freed memory is accessed later. Additionally, the code does not check if `iconInfo->bitsMask` or `iconInfo->colorTable` are NULL after `realloc` fails, potentially leading to further issues."
"3","True","CWE-129","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a pointer to a memory location is overwritten with a new address, but the original address is still referenced. This can lead to the memory being freed, and the pointer being used to access the freed memory, resulting in undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. `realloc` is used to resize `iconInfo->bitsMask`, `iconInfo->colorTable`, `iconInfo->bitsColor`, and `newBitMask`. If `realloc` fails, the original pointer is freed, and the code continues to use the freed memory. This can lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior. Additionally, the code frees `iconInfo->bitsMask` before reallocating it, which is also a potential issue."
