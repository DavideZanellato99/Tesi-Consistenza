"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Control of Build-Time and Run-Time Data","A vulnerability that occurs when an application uses data from external sources (such as user input or configuration files) to construct strings or other data structures without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other security issues.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `cJSON_malloc` allocates memory for the string, but the loop copying characters from the input string to the allocated buffer does not perform bounds checking. If the input string contains a sequence of characters that results in a larger string than initially allocated, the `out` buffer will be overwritten, leading to a buffer overflow. The `parse_hex4` function is used to handle escaped characters, but it doesn't prevent the overall string length from exceeding the allocated memory."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper Control of Build Order","A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated memory boundary. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `cJSON_malloc` allocates memory for the string, but the loop copying characters from the input string to the allocated buffer does not perform bounds checking. If the input string contains a sequence of characters that results in a larger string than initially allocated, the `out` buffer will be overwritten, leading to a buffer overflow. The `parse_hex4` function is used to handle unicode characters, but the logic for handling UTF-16 surrogate pairs is complex and might not correctly prevent overflows in all cases."
