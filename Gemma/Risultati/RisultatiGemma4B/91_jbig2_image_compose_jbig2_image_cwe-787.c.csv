"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations and security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `bytewidth`. Specifically, `bytewidth = (((uint32_t) x + w - 1) >> 3) - leftbyte + 1;` can overflow if `x` and `w` are large, leading to an incorrect value for `bytewidth`. This incorrect `bytewidth` can then lead to out-of-bounds memory access when `jbig2_image_compose_opt_*` functions are called."
