"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper manipulation of integer values can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities.","The `TIFFSeekCustomStream` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The `offset` parameter can be large, and the calculations involving `profile->offset` and `profile->length` can result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect offset value. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the file offset and potentially read or write arbitrary memory locations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improperly handled multiplication or addition in arithmetic operations can lead to integer overflow or underflow.","The `TIFFSeekCustomStream` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The `offset` parameter can be large, and the calculations involving `profile->offset` and `profile->length` can result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect offset value. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the file offset and potentially read or write arbitrary memory locations."
