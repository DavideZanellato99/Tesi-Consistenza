"1","True","CWE-399","Use of a Parallel or Concurrent Data Structure Without Proper Synchronization","A data structure is used in a concurrent environment without proper synchronization, leading to unexpected results.","The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition. Multiple threads could simultaneously increment `peerCounter` and add a peer to `m_peers`. Without proper synchronization, `peerCounter` could overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash. The `pop_front()` operation could also be vulnerable if not properly synchronized."
"2","True","CWE-399","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a program accesses memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition.
