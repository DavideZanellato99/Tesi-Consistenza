"1","True","CWE-129","Buffer not Null-Terminated","The buffer pointed to by a variable is not null-terminated, which can lead to reading beyond the allocated memory region.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while` loop within the `TT_WORD` token recognition. The `*end` pointer is not incremented within the loop, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer not Aleady Owned","A buffer was not already owned by the caller.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while` loop within the `TT_WORD` token recognition. The `*end` pointer is not incremented within the loop, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write if the token length exceeds the allocated buffer."
"3","True","CWE-129","Buffer not Aleast as Large as Maximum Length","A buffer is read from, but is not large enough to contain the entire input.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while` loop within the `TT_WORD` token recognition. The `*end` pointer is not incremented within the loop, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"4","True","CWE-129","Buffer not Aleast as Large as Maximum Length","A buffer is read from, but is not large enough to contain the entire input.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `while` loop within the `TT_WORD` token recognition.
