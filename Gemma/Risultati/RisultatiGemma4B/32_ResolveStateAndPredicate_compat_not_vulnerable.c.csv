"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected program behavior or vulnerabilities. This can occur when user-supplied input is not properly validated, resulting in unexpected data being processed by the program.","The code contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of `istreq` function, which is not a standard C function and its behavior is undefined. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the implementation of `istreq` is flawed. Specifically, the `istreq` function compares strings, and if the string comparison is not implemented correctly, it could lead to vulnerabilities."
