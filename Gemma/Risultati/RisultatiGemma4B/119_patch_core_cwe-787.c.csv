"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overread","A program reads data from a buffer with insufficient bounds checking.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `x` or `y` are too large, and underflow `newData` if `x` or `y` are too small. The checks for overflow and underflow are performed, but the logic is complex and might not cover all possible scenarios. The code also has type checking for the tuple elements, which is good."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overread","A program reads data from a buffer and writes past the boundary of the buffer.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `newpos + x` exceeds `newDataLength`. Similarly, the `memcpy` operations for `extraPtr` can underflow if `extraPtr + y` exceeds `extraBlock + extraBlockLength`. The code also checks for tuple size and type errors, but doesn't fully validate the input data lengths, leading to potential overflows."
