"1","True","CWE-129","Buffer not aligned correctly","The buffer is not aligned correctly, leading to potential issues with memory access.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The loop iterates up to `data_size - header_size`, but if `data_size` is small and `header_size` is large, the loop condition `i < data_size - header_size` can cause the loop to continue beyond the valid bounds of the `data` buffer, leading to a read-after-write or other memory corruption issues."
"2","True","CWE-129","Buffer not aligned correctly","The buffer is not aligned correctly, leading to potential issues with memory access and security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The loop iterates up to `data_size - header_size`, but if `data_size` is small and `header_size` is large, the loop condition `i < data_size - header_size` can cause the loop to access memory outside the bounds of the `data` buffer. Specifically, if `data_size` is small, `data[i]` could be out of bounds."

The loop iterates up to `data_size - header_size`, but if `data_size` is small and `header_size` is large, the loop condition `i < data_size - header_size` can cause the loop to continue beyond the valid bounds of the `data` buffer, leading to a potential memory corruption issue."
"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy/Use After Buffer","A buffer is written past the boundary of its allocated space.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
