"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type of the variable involved. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `TIFFWritePixels` function. The `y` parameter, representing the scanline number, is an `ssize_t`. If `image->rows` is a large value, the calculation `y < (ssize_t) image->rows` could lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing the loop to iterate beyond the valid bounds of the image, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
