"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer without sufficient bounds checking, potentially leading to the reading of memory beyond the allocated buffer.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `cJSON_malloc(len+1)` allocates memory for the string, but the loop doesn't check if `len` is within reasonable bounds before allocating. If the input string contains a very large number of escaped characters, `len` could be excessively large, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the string into the allocated memory."
