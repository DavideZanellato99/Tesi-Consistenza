"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type of the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, and potentially security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadBlobXXXLong` function when handling the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `MATLAB_HDR.SizeX` fields. Specifically, the line `if((MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image))` checks if the combined size of `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `filepos` exceeds the total blob size. If `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is a large value, adding it to `filepos` could result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect comparison and potentially skipping or misinterpreting data within the blob. This could lead to corrupted images or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `ReadBlobXXXLong` function itself could be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the size read from the blob is larger than the allocated buffer."
"2","True","CWE-190","An integer overflow or underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type of the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadBlobXXXLong` function when reading the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `MATLAB_HDR.SizeX` fields. If these values are large, their sum could exceed the maximum value of `unsigned long`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the memory required for the image data. This could result in a buffer overflow or other memory-related issues when allocating memory for the image data. Additionally, the `SeekBlob` function is used multiple times, and if the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is large, the `SeekBlob` calls could potentially cause a buffer overflow if the size is not properly validated."
