"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination data type.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `offset += size` loop. If `size` is large, `offset` could overflow, leading to an incorrect sample offset and potentially causing data corruption or unexpected behavior."
