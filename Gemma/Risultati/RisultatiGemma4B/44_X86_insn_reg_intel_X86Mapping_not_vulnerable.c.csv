"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.","The code uses a binary search algorithm on a sorted array `insn_regs_intel_sorted`. However, the array is not guaranteed to be sorted before the `qsort` call. If the input `id` is outside the range of the sorted array, the binary search logic might not correctly identify the insertion point, potentially leading to incorrect results or out-of-bounds access if the logic is flawed."

However, the array is not guaranteed to be sorted before the `qsort` call. If the input `id` is outside the range of the sorted array, the binary search logic might not correctly identify the boundary, potentially leading to incorrect results or out-of-bounds access if the `insn_regs_intel_sorted` array is used directly without proper validation."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflows, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code uses a binary search algorithm on a sorted array `insn_regs_intel_sorted`. However, the array is not guaranteed to be sorted before the `qsort` call.

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.","The code uses a binary search algorithm on a sorted array `insn_regs_intel_sorted`. However, the `intel_regs_sorted` flag is initialized to `false` and set to `true` only once. If the array is not sorted initially, the binary search will not work correctly, potentially leading to incorrect results or an infinite loop. The `qsort` function is used to sort the array, but the comparison function `regs_cmp` is not provided, making the sorting unreliable."
"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflows, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code uses a binary search algorithm on a sorted array `insn_regs_intel_sorted`. However, the `intel_regs_sorted` flag is only set once, and the array is not sorted before the binary search. This means that the binary search is performed on an unsorted array, potentially leading to incorrect results or infinite loops if the input `id` is not within the range of the unsorted array."
