"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe and does not contain any immediately obvious vulnerabilities. It adds peer information to a Qt model, populating various columns with data from a `BitTorrent::PeerInfo` object. The use of `toHtmlEscaped` for `peer.client()` suggests an attempt to prevent XSS, which is a good practice."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe. It adds peer information to a Qt model, using appropriate data types and roles. There are no obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or injection vulnerabilities. The use of `toHtmlEscaped` for `peer.client()` mitigates potential HTML injection risks."
