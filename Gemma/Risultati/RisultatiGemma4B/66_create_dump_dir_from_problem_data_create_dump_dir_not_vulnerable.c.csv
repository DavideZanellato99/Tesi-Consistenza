"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to vulnerabilities such as format string bugs, buffer overflows, and other security issues.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `xasprintf` function. The format string `%s-%s.%ld-%lu` is directly used to construct the `problem_id` string without any sanitization. If the `type` or `iso_date_string` functions return a string containing format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%d`, `%lu`), these specifiers could be interpreted by `xasprintf`, leading to arbitrary code execution.  Additionally, the `getpid()` function can return a value that contains format specifiers."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and denial of service attacks.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `xasprintf` function.

If `type`, `tv.tv_sec`, `tv.tv_usec`, or `getpid()` contain format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`), they could be exploited to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations."
