"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `TIFFWritePixels` function. The `y` parameter, representing the scanline number, is an `ssize_t`. If `image->rows` is a large value, the calculation `y < (ssize_t) image->rows` could lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing the loop to continue indefinitely or to access memory outside the bounds of the image data. This is exacerbated by the fact that the loop increments `y` in each iteration."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the TIFFWritePixels function. The `y` parameter, representing the scanline number, is an `ssize_t`. If `image->rows` is a large value, the calculation `y < (ssize_t) image->rows` could lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing the loop to continue indefinitely or to access memory outside the bounds of the image data. This is exacerbated by the use of `ssize_t` which can be larger than `int`."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type of the variable involved. This can lead to incorrect results, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `TIFFWritePixels` function. The `y` parameter, representing the scanline number, is an `ssize_t`. If `image->rows` is a large value, the calculation `y < (ssize_t) image->rows` could lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing the loop to iterate beyond the valid bounds of the image, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior."
