"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer without sufficient bounds checking, potentially leading to the reading of data beyond the allocated buffer.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string. If the `path` argument is longer than `destlen - 1`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer without sufficient bounds checking, potentially leading to the reading of data beyond the buffer's allocated memory.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string. If the `path` argument is longer than `destlen - 1`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A buffer over-read occurs when a program reads more data from a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string. If the `path` argument is longer than `destlen - 1`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer without checking its size, potentially leading to an over-read.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string. If the `path` argument is longer than `destlen - 1`, a buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."
"5","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A buffer over-read occurs when a program reads more data from a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to data corruption or security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string.
