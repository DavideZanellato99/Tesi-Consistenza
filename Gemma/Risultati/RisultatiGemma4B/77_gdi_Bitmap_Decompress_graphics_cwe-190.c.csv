"1","True","CWE-178","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be stored in the variable.","The code uses `_aligned_malloc` with a specific alignment requirement (16 bytes). If `bitmap->length` is not a multiple of 16, `_aligned_malloc` may return NULL, leading to a crash or undefined behavior. This is a potential memory allocation failure."
