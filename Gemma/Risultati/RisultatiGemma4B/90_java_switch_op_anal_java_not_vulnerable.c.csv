"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination type.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `pos`. The expression `(offset+1)%4 ? 1 + 4 - (offset+1)%4 : 1` is used to determine the number of bytes to skip, which could lead to an incorrect value for `pos` if `offset` is large. This could lead to reading beyond the bounds of the `data` array. Additionally, the code uses `UINT` to convert bytes to `ut32`, which could lead to integer overflow if the input data is not properly validated."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in arithmetic.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `pos`. The expression `(offset+1)%4 ? 1 + 4 - (offset+1)%4 : 1` is used to determine the number of bytes to skip, which could lead to an incorrect value for `pos` if `offset` is large. This incorrect `pos` value can lead to out-of-bounds reads when accessing the `data` array. Additionally, the code uses `UINT` to convert bytes to `ut32`, which could lead to integer overflow if the input data is not properly validated."
