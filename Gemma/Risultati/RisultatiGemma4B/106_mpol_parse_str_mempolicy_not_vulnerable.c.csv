"1","True","CWE-129","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer without checking its size, potentially leading to the reading of more data than the buffer can hold.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `nodelist_parse` function if the `nodelist` string contains a very long sequence of digits. The `while (isdigit(*rest))` loop continues indefinitely if `rest` points to a sequence of digits without a terminating null character. This can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the `rest` pointer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a crash or security vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient input validation, which can allow an attacker to provide input that causes a program to behave in an unintended way.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `nodelist_parse` function if the `nodelist` string contains a very long sequence of digits.
