"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper bounds checking leads to integer overflow, which can cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The `TIFFSeekCustomStream` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The `offset` parameter can be positive or negative, and the code performs calculations on `profile->offset` without proper bounds checking. Specifically, `SEEK_CUR` can lead to an overflow if the offset is too large or too small relative to the current offset and the maximum/minimum possible offset values. `SEEK_END` can also lead to an overflow if the offset is too large."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper bounds checking leads to integer overflow, which can cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The `TIFFSeekCustomStream` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The `offset` parameter can be positive or negative, and the code performs calculations on `profile->offset` without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `SEEK_CUR` case checks for overflow when adding `offset` to `profile->offset`. The `SEEK_END` case also checks for overflow when adding `offset` to `profile->length`. If `offset` is large enough, the result can wrap around, leading to an incorrect `profile->offset` value and potentially causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improperly handled numeric overflows can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.","The `TIFFSeekCustomStream` function is vulnerable to integer overflow when seeking using `SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END`. The calculations involving `profile->offset` and `offset` can exceed the maximum value of `MagickOffsetType`, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. Specifically, the checks for overflow are not comprehensive and do not account for all possible overflow scenarios."
