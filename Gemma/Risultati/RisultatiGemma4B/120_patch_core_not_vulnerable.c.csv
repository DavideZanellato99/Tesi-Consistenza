"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads beyond the intended buffer boundary, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `newpos + x` or `extraPtr + y` exceeds the allocated size of `newData` or `extraBlock`, respectively. Additionally, the code checks for underflow but doesn't handle it properly, potentially leading to out-of-bounds writes. The use of `PyMem_Malloc` and `PyMem_Free` without proper error handling can also lead to memory leaks."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads beyond the intended buffer boundary, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `newpos + x` or `extraPtr + y` exceeds the allocated size of `newData` or `extraBlock`, respectively. Also, the code checks for underflow but only for `oldpos`, not for `newpos` or `diffPtr`/`extraPtr`."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads data from a buffer but continues reading past the boundary of the buffer.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `x` or `y` are too large. Also, the checks for `newpos + x > newDataLength` and `extraPtr + y > extraBlock + extraBlockLength` are insufficient to prevent underflows. The code also has type checking issues and potential errors if the input tuple is not of size 3."
"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program reads beyond the intended buffer boundary, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains potential buffer overflows and underflows. Specifically, the `memcpy` operations within the loop can overflow `newData` if `newpos + x` or `extraPtr + y` exceeds the allocated size of `newData` or `extraBlock`, respectively. Additionally, the final checks for `newpos` and `diffPtr` can lead to underflows if the loop doesn't consume all the data."
