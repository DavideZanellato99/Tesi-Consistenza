"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of the size of a variable or expression.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `j` when handling length-prefixed strings with pointer offsets. Specifically, the line `j = (((int)label_len & 0x3f) << 8) + ptr_low;` can overflow if `label_len` and `ptr_low` are large enough. This overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds read or write."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of the size of a variable or expression.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `j` calculation within the `if (label_len & 0xc0)` block. Specifically, `j = (((int)label_len & 0x3f) << 8) + ptr_low;` can overflow if `label_len` and `ptr_low` are large enough. This overflow can lead to out-of-bounds memory access when `j` is used to index into the `packet`."
