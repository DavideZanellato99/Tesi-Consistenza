"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper integer conversion or arithmetic. An integer variable or expression contains values that are outside the valid range for its type.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `rds_rdma_cookie_offset` calculation. The `args->cookie` field is an integer, and its offset is added to `args->remote_addr`. If `args->cookie` is large, the result of the addition could overflow, leading to an incorrect `args->remote_addr` value. This could be exploited to cause memory corruption or other security issues."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, and potentially security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `rds_rdma_cookie_offset` calculation.
