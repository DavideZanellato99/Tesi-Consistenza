"1","True","CWE-120","Heap buffer overflow","A heap buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the bounds of a buffer allocated on the heap. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `r_asn1_create_object` function is called with `buffer` and `length`. If `length` is larger than the actual data in `buffer`, `r_asn1_create_object` might write beyond the allocated memory for `object->list.objects[0]->sector`. The subsequent `r_asn1_stringify_oid` function could also lead to a buffer overflow if the OID is larger than expected. The lack of bounds checking on `length` and the potential for oversized OIDs makes this code vulnerable."
