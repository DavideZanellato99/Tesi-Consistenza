"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected program behavior, including crashes, security vulnerabilities, and incorrect results.","The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `LY_TYPE_INST` case when parsing expressions. The `lyxp_expr_free(exp)` call is missing, which can lead to memory leaks if the expression parsing fails. Additionally, the `count` variable is not properly managed, potentially leading to writing beyond the allocated buffer size `buf_len`. The `sprintf` function is used without proper bounds checking, increasing the risk of buffer overflows."
