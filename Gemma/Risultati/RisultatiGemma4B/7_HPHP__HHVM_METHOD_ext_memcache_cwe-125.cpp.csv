"1","True","CWE-139","Format String Bug","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string, allowing an attacker to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `snprintf` function. The `stats_key` buffer is allocated with a fixed size of 30 bytes. If the hostname or port exceeds this size, a buffer overflow can occur, leading to potential code execution."
