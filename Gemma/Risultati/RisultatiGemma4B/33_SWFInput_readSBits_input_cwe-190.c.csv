"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper manipulation of integer values can lead to unexpected results, including incorrect calculations and security vulnerabilities.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. If `number` is large, `1<<(number-1)` can be greater than or equal to the maximum value that can be stored in an `int`. The bitwise AND operation `num & (1<<(number-1))` might not reliably detect this overflow, leading to incorrect results and potential vulnerabilities."
