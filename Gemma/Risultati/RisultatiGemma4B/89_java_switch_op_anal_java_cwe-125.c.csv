"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `pos`. The expression `(offset+1)%4 ? 1 + 4 - (offset+1)%4 : 1` is used to determine the offset within the data block. If `offset` is large, the modulo operation can lead to incorrect values for `pos`, potentially causing out-of-bounds access when reading data from `data`. Additionally, the `r_anal_switch_op_add_case` function might be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the calculated offset is not properly validated."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in arithmetic.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `pos`. The expression `(offset+1)%4 ? 1 + 4 - (offset+1)%4 : 1` is used to determine the offset within the data block. If `offset` is large, the modulo operation can lead to incorrect values for `pos`, potentially causing out-of-bounds access when reading data from `data`. Additionally, the code uses `UINT` to convert bytes to `ut32`, which could lead to integer overflows if the input data contains values outside the range of `ut32`."
