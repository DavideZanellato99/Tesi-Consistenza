"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper handling of values resulting in an integer overflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of `cmptparm.w` and `cmptparm.h` due to the multiplication and addition operations involving `w`, `h`, and `parameters->subsampling_dx` and `parameters->subsampling_dy`.  If `w` or `h` are large, or `parameters->subsampling_dx` or `parameters->subsampling_dy` are large, the result of these calculations can exceed the maximum value of `OPJ_UINT32`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can cause incorrect image dimensions and potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access when the image is used later."
