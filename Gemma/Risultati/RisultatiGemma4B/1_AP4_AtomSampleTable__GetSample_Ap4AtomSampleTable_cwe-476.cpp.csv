"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflows, leading to an unexpected result.","The code snippet appears to be well-structured and performs necessary checks before accessing data structures. It includes error handling and bounds checking to prevent potential issues. However, it lacks input validation for the `index` parameter. An attacker could potentially provide a negative or excessively large `index` value, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflows, leading to an unexpected result.","The code snippet appears to be well-structured and performs necessary checks before accessing data structures. It includes error handling and bounds checking to prevent potential issues. However, it lacks input validation for the `index` parameter, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if an invalid index is provided."
"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be well-structured and performs necessary checks before accessing data structures. It includes error handling for invalid formats and out-of-bounds access. The index adjustment and description index adjustment are also correctly implemented."
"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be well-structured and performs necessary checks before accessing data structures. It includes error handling for invalid formats and out-of-bounds access. The index adjustment and chunk offset calculations seem correct."
