"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be stored in the destination data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadBlobXXXLong` function when reading the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `MATLAB_HDR.SizeX` fields. If these values are large, their sum in the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize + filepos` check could overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write. Additionally, the `SeekBlob` function could be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the `filepos` is not properly managed. The `ReadBlob` function itself could be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the size of the data being read is not properly validated."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow or underflow can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large or too small to be represented by the data type of the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations, memory corruption, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadBlobXXXLong` function when reading the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `MATLAB_HDR.SizeX` fields. If these values are large, their sum could exceed the maximum value of `unsigned long`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the available memory and potentially causing a buffer overflow or other memory-related issues later in the code. Additionally, the `SeekBlob` function might lead to out-of-bounds reads if the `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is not correctly calculated."
