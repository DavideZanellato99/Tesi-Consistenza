"1","True","CWE-178","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer overflow or underflow can occur when the size of a memory buffer is treated as an unsigned integer and used in an arithmetic operation.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `result`, but it doesn't check if `size` is zero. If `size` is zero, `calloc` returns `NULL`, which is then used as the `result` pointer. The subsequent `LY_CHECK_ERR_RETURN` checks if `result` is `NULL`, but the `calloc` call itself is not handled correctly when `size` is zero. This could lead to a crash or undefined behavior if the code attempts to use `result` after it's been allocated with a size of zero."
