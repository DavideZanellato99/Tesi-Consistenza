"1","True","CWE-362","Improper check of return values","A function or method does not perform an error check on a return value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential race condition. The `net` parameter passed to `rds_tcp_kill_sock` might change between the initial check (`if (net != c_net) continue;`) and the subsequent operations. If another thread simultaneously modifies the `c_net` of a connection `tc`, the `if (net != c_net)` check will fail, leading to incorrect behavior and potential vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-362","Improper check of return values","A function may assume that a value is valid, but it is not.

The `net` parameter passed to `rds_tcp_kill_sock` might change between the initial check (`if (net != c_net) continue;`) and the subsequent operations.
