"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname Makes Files Accessible","A pathname is improperly limited, allowing an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory.","The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is insufficient to prevent malicious users from manipulating the path to access files outside the intended tar archive. By adding ""/"" + getFilename() to the path, a user could potentially construct a path that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., ""../"") to access files in the parent directory or other sensitive locations."
"2","True","CWE-22","Path Traversal","Improper limitation of a pathname makes path traversal possible. An application does not properly limit the pathname used to access a file, allowing an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory.","The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is insufficient to prevent malicious users from manipulating the path to access files outside the intended tar archive. By injecting ""../"" into the path, an attacker could potentially access files in the parent directory."
"3","True","CWE-22","Path Traversal","Improper limitation of a pathname makes path traversal possible. An application does not properly limit the pathnames used in operations such as file access, which allows an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory.","The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is insufficient to prevent malicious users from manipulating the path to access files outside the intended tar archive. If `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` returns true, the code appends the filename to the path, which could be used to traverse to arbitrary files on the system."
"4","True","CWE-22","Path Traversal","Improper limitation of a pathname makes path traversal possible. An application does not properly limit a pathname, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and access unauthorized files.","The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is insufficient to prevent malicious users from manipulating the path to access files outside the intended tar archive. If `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` returns false, but the path is crafted to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ""../""), it could lead to reading arbitrary files on the system."
"5","True","CWE-22","Path Traversal","Improper limitation of a pathname makes path traversal possible. An application does not properly limit the pathname used in a function call, allowing an attacker to traverse into unintended directories.","The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check is insufficient to prevent malicious users from manipulating the path to access files outside the intended tar archive. By injecting ""../"" into the path, an attacker could potentially access files in the parent directory or any directory above it."
