"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe. It uses a `QWriteLocker` to protect the `lock` from race conditions, ensuring thread safety. The `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES` limit prevents unbounded memory growth by removing the oldest message when the limit is reached. The `emit newLogMessage` signal is used to notify listeners of new log messages."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe. It uses a `QWriteLocker` to protect the `lock` from race conditions during concurrent access. It also implements a simple circular buffer to limit the number of log messages, preventing unbounded memory growth."
"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe. It uses a mutex (`lock`) to protect access to the `m_messages` vector, preventing race conditions. The `QWriteLocker` ensures exclusive access during the modification of the vector. The `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES` limit prevents unbounded growth of the log, and the `pop_front()` operation maintains the limit."
"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be safe. It uses a `QWriteLocker` to protect the `lock` from race conditions during concurrent access. It also implements a simple circular buffer to limit the number of log messages, preventing unbounded memory growth."
