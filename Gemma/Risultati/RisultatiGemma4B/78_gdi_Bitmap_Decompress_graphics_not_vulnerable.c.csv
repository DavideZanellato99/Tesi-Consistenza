"1","True","CWE-178","Improperly Defined Pads","A padding value is not defined or is not used correctly, leading to potential issues with memory alignment and data access.","The code uses `_aligned_malloc` with a fixed alignment of 16 bytes. If the `bitmap->length` is not a multiple of 16, the allocated memory may not be properly aligned, leading to potential issues with memory access and potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior."
"2","True","CWE-178","Improperly Defined Pads","A variable is declared with a padding that is not properly defined, leading to potential issues with memory alignment.","The code uses `_aligned_malloc` with a specific alignment value (16). If the `bitmap->length` is not a multiple of 16, the allocated memory might not be properly aligned, leading to potential issues with memory access and potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior."
