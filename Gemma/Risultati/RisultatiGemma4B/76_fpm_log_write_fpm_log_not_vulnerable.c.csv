"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and SQL injection.  The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious data that can compromise the system.","The code contains a format string vulnerability due to the use of `%s`, `%c`, and other format specifiers within the `log_format` string. If `log_format` is not a valid format string, or if it contains malicious format specifiers, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure. Specifically, the `snprintf` function is used to format the output, but the input `format` string is constructed directly from the `log_format` string, which is potentially controlled by an attacker. The `switch` statement handles different format specifiers, but it doesn't perform any sanitization or validation of the `format` string.  The `strftime` function also has potential vulnerabilities if the format string is not carefully controlled."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected program behavior or security vulnerabilities. This includes, but is not limited to, format string vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and injection attacks.","The code contains a format string vulnerability due to the use of `%s` and other format specifiers within the `log_format` string.

"3","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including format string bugs, buffer overflows, and SQL injection.
