"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient bounds checking, which can allow an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated from the first two bytes of the `*p` pointer, and then used to advance the pointer `*p` by `len` bytes. If `len` is greater than the remaining space between `*p` and `end`, it will write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy from Unsafe Source","A buffer is copied from an unsafe source. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, heap overflows, and format string vulnerabilities.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated from the first two bytes of the `*p` pointer, and then used to advance the pointer `*p` by `len` bytes. If `len` is greater than the remaining space between `*p` and `end`, it will write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy from Unsafe Source","A buffer is copied from a source that is not properly validated, leading to a potential buffer overflow.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated from the first two bytes of the `*p` pointer, and then used to advance the pointer `*p` by `len` bytes. If `len` is greater than the remaining space between `*p` and the end of the buffer (`end`), a buffer overflow occurs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."
"4","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `len` variable is calculated from the first two bytes of the `*p` pointer, and then used to advance the pointer `*p` by `len` bytes. If `len` is greater than the remaining space between `*p` and `end`, it will write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
