"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes data past the allocated memory boundary of a buffer. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `cx24116_send_diseqc_msg` function. Specifically, the `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` is used to calculate the length of the command, which is then used to access the `dsec_cmd.args` array. If `d->msg_len` is greater than `CX24116_ARGLEN - CX24116_DISEQC_MSGOFS`, the code will write beyond the bounds of the `dsec_cmd.args` array, leading to a buffer overflow."
