"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper integer conversion or arithmetic.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `jbd2_journal_stop(handle)` function might return a value that is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the `err` variable. If this happens, `err = rc` will overwrite the value of `err` with the overflowed value, leading to incorrect error handling and potentially exploitable behavior."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","An integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect results, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `jbd2_journal_stop(handle)` function might return a value that is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the `err` variable. If this happens, `err` will wrap around, leading to incorrect error handling and potentially bypassing security checks."
