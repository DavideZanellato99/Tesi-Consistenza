"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is read or written to without sufficient boundary checking.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates based on `passInstructions[passIC + 1]`, which determines the number of iterations. If `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than the size of `passInstructions`, the loop will write beyond the bounds of the `passInstructions` array, leading to a buffer overflow. The `kk++` inside the `if` condition further exacerbates this issue by incrementing the index `kk` after the comparison, potentially overwriting memory beyond the intended bounds."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and injection attacks.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates based on `passInstructions[passIC + 1]`, which determines the number of characters to compare. If `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than the size of `passInstructions`, the loop will write beyond the bounds of the `passInstructions` array, leading to a buffer overflow. The `kk++` inside the `if` statement further exacerbates this issue by incrementing the index `kk` after the comparison, potentially overwriting memory beyond the intended bounds."
"3","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the end of its allocated memory.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
