"1","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer over-read occurs when a program reads beyond the allocated memory region for a buffer. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `pipeline_c` function. The `pipeline_c` function is responsible for processing the input data and applying filters. If the compressed size (`maxout`) calculated by `pipeline_c` exceeds the available buffer size (`maxbytes`), the code attempts to write beyond the bounds of the `dest` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. The check `if (ntbytes + maxout > maxbytes)` is present, but it's performed *after* `maxout` is calculated, potentially allowing a larger write than intended.  Furthermore, the `cbytes` variable, representing the compressed size, is not always checked against `maxout` before the `memcpy` operation, which could still lead to a buffer overflow if `cbytes` is larger than `maxout`."

"4","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A type of buffer overflow where a program writes beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer in memory.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `pipeline_c` function. The `pipeline_c` function is not properly sized, and the `_tmp` and `_tmp2` buffers are allocated statically. If the compressed data exceeds the size of these buffers, a buffer overflow can occur. Additionally, the `pipeline_c` function could potentially return `NULL` if there's an error, but the code doesn't handle this case properly, leading to undefined behavior."
