"1","True","CWE-119","Improper memory freeing","Failure to free memory can lead to memory leaks or double-free errors.","The code allocates memory for `instance->cmd_list` and then iterates through a loop to allocate individual `struct megasas_cmd` instances. If allocation fails at any point within the loop, the code attempts to free previously allocated memory before returning an error. However, it does not properly handle the case where `instance->cmd_list` is not NULL before attempting to free memory. This can lead to a double-free or use-after-free vulnerability if `instance->cmd_list` is not initialized correctly."
