"1","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A type of buffer overflow that occurs when a heap-allocated buffer is written beyond its boundaries.","The code uses `inflate` without proper bounds checking on `zstream.next_out`. If `inflate` writes beyond the allocated buffer pointed to by `bp->str`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and gain control of the program."
"2","True","CWE-120","Heap-Based Buffer Overflow","A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when a program writes beyond the bounds of a buffer allocated on the heap.","The code uses `inflate` without proper bounds checking on `zstream.next_out`. If `inflate` returns `Z_STREAM_END` before `zstream.avail_in` becomes 0, the `bp->len += zstream.next_out - buf;` line could potentially write beyond the allocated buffer `bp->str`. This is a buffer overflow vulnerability."
"3","True","CWE-120","Heap Buffer Overflow","A type of heap-based buffer overflow where the size of the buffer is not properly checked before writing to it.","The code uses `inflate` without proper bounds checking on `zstream.next_out`. If `inflate` writes beyond the allocated buffer pointed to by `bp->str`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and gain control of the program."
