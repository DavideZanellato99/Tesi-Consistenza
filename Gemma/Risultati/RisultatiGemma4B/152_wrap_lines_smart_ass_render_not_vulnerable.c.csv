"1","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `while (!exit && render_priv->state.wrap_style != 1)` loop. Specifically, the loop iterates through the `text_info->glyphs` array, and within the loop, it repeatedly decrements `w` until it finds a space or the beginning of the string. If the text contains a large number of consecutive spaces, `w` could be decremented beyond the bounds of the `text_info->glyphs` array, leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-119","Model Exhaustion","A model exhaustion vulnerability occurs when an application consumes excessive memory or other resources, leading to a denial of service. This can be caused by unbounded memory allocation, excessive recursion, or other resource-intensive operations.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the `realloc` function used to resize the `text_info->lines` array. If `text_info->max_lines` is increased significantly, `realloc` might allocate insufficient memory, leading to a buffer overflow when writing to the newly allocated memory. The `realloc` function can return NULL if it fails to allocate memory, but the code doesn't check for this return value, potentially causing a crash or undefined behavior."
"3","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated bounds of the buffer.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `while (!exit && render_priv->state.wrap_style != 1)` loop. Specifically, the loop iterates through the `text_info->glyphs` array using a pointer `w` which is decremented until it finds a space or the beginning of the string. If the string contains a large number of consecutive spaces, `w` can be decremented past the beginning of the `text_info->glyphs` array, leading to a buffer overflow when `w` is dereferenced."
"4","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated bounds of its declared size.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `while (!exit && render_priv->state.wrap_style != 1)` loop. Specifically, the loop iterates through the `text_info->glyphs` array using a pointer `w` which is decremented until it finds a space or the beginning of the string. If the text contains a long sequence of spaces, `w` can be decremented past the beginning of the `text_info->glyphs` array, leading to a buffer overflow when `w` is dereferenced."
"5","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected program behavior, including crashes, security vulnerabilities, and incorrect results.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `while (!exit && render_priv->state.wrap_style != 1)` loop. Specifically, the loop iterates through the `text_info->glyphs` array, and within the loop, the `while ((w > s1) && (w->symbol == ' '))` loop increments `w` until it finds a non-space character or reaches the beginning of the array. If the text contains a long sequence of spaces, `w` can potentially increment beyond the bounds of the `text_info->glyphs` array, leading to a buffer overflow."
