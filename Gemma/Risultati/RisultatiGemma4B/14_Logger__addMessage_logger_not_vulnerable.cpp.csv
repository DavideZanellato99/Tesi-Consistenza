"1","True","CWE-326","Resource Management - Missing Cleanup","A resource is allocated but never released. This can lead to resource exhaustion or other problems.","The code uses a `QWriteLocker` which provides exclusive access to the `lock` mutex. However, if `Utils::String::toHtmlEscaped(message)` throws an exception, the `QWriteLocker` will not be released, leading to a deadlock. This is a potential race condition if another thread attempts to acquire the lock while the logging thread is blocked due to the exception."
