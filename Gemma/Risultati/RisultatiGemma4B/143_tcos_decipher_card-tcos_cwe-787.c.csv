"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient bounds checking, which can allow an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function when extracting data from the APDU response. Specifically, the `while` loop condition `offset<len && apdu.resp[offset]!=0` might not be sufficient to prevent writing beyond the bounds of the `out` buffer if `apdu.resp` contains consecutive null bytes. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `len` is larger than the allocated size of `out`."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient bounds checking on input data.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function when extracting data from the APDU response. Specifically, the `while` loop condition `offset<len && apdu.resp[offset]!=0` might not be sufficient to handle cases where the APDU response contains consecutive null bytes, leading to reading beyond the intended bounds of the `out` buffer."
"3","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the program's execution flow.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function when extracting data from the APDU response.
