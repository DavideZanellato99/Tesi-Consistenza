"1","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer over-read or buffer over-write.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop condition `k < passIC + 2 + passInstructions[passIC + 1]` calculates the upper bound of the loop based on the length of `passInstructions`. If `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than the intended length, the loop might continue beyond the bounds of `passInstructions`, leading to a buffer overflow when `input->chars[kk++]` is accessed. The `kk++` inside the `if` statement increments the index `kk` after the comparison, potentially overwriting memory beyond the intended bounds."
"2","True","CWE-120","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is read or written, but the size of the buffer is not checked to determine whether the operation will cause an array index out of bounds.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop condition `k < passIC + 2 + passInstructions[passIC + 1]` calculates the upper bound of the loop based on the length of `passInstructions`. If `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than expected, it could lead to an out-of-bounds access when `k` is incremented. The `kk++` inside the `if` statement further exacerbates this risk, as it increments the index `kk` in each iteration, potentially exceeding the bounds of `input->length`."
"3","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop condition `k < passIC + 2 + passInstructions[passIC + 1]` calculates the upper bound of the loop based on the length of `passInstructions`. If `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than expected, it could lead to an out-of-bounds access when `kk++` is executed inside the `if` statement. The `kk++` increments the index `kk` within the loop, potentially exceeding the bounds of `input->chars` if `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is too large."

"5","True","CWE-120","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient bounds checking, which can result in buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.","The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
