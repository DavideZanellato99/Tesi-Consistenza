"1","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A buffer is written past the allocated memory boundary.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `form_update_line` function. The `spos` and `epos` variables are used to define the start and end positions of the text to be updated in the buffer. If the `form->type` is `FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD`, the code does not check if `spos` and `epos` are within the bounds of the `lineBuf` array, leading to a potential buffer overflow if `spos` or `epos` are out of range."

"5","True","CWE-129","Improper Bounds Checking","A vulnerability exists where the program does not check bounds before accessing a memory location. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `form_update_line` function. The `spos` and `epos` variables are used to define the start and end positions of the text to be updated in the buffer. If the `form->type` is `FORM_INPUT_PASSWORD`, the code does not perform bounds checking on `spos` and `epos` before writing to `buf->currentLine->lineBuf`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `spos` or `epos` are outside the bounds of `buf->currentLine->lineBuf`."
