"1","True","CWE-20","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability exists when user-supplied input is included in a format string, allowing an attacker to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `sscanf` function. Although `sscanf` is used with fixed format specifiers, the input string `str` is not sanitized. An attacker could craft a malicious input string that contains format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to a security breach."
"2","True","CWE-20","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string, allowing an attacker to control the format of the output and potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `sscanf` function. Although `sscanf` is used with fixed width specifiers, the input string `str` is not sanitized.

"5","True","CWE-20","Format String Vulnerability","A format string vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is included in a format string, allowing an attacker to control the format of the output and potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the `sscanf` function. Although `sscanf` is used with fixed width integer fields, the input string `str` is not sanitized or validated before being passed to `sscanf`. An attacker could craft a malicious input string that contains format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) to potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to a security breach."
