"1","True","CWE-129","Buffer not aligned by pointer boundary","A buffer is not aligned by a pointer boundary, which can lead to performance problems or crashes.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The loop iterates up to `data_size - header_size`, which could be a large value. If `data_size` is large and `header_size` is relatively small, the loop could iterate a significant number of times, potentially overflowing the buffer if `data` is not properly allocated and sized. The `pos` variable is not reset, so if a match is found, the loop breaks, but the `pos` value might be incorrect if multiple matches exist."
"2","True","CWE-129","Buffer not Null-Terminated","The buffer is not null-terminated, which can lead to issues when using the buffer with functions that require null termination, such as `printf` or `fgets`.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The loop iterates up to `data_size - header_size`, which could be a large value. If `data_size` is large and `header_size` is relatively small, the loop could iterate a significant number of times, potentially overflowing the buffer if `data` is not properly allocated. The `pos` variable is not checked for validity after the loop, so it could be out of bounds."
