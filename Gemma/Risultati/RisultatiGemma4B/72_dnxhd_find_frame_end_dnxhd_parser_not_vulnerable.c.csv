"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in arithmetic.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating `dctx->remaining`. Specifically, the line `dctx->remaining = remaining;` within the `else if (pic_found)` block can lead to an integer overflow if `remaining` is a large value. This could result in a negative `dctx->remaining` value, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes or incorrect frame size calculations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in a calculation.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` function call. If `cid` is greater than the maximum value representable by an integer, `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` might return a value that causes an integer overflow when assigned to `dctx->remaining`. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of the integer type in an arithmetic operation.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` function call. If `cid` is greater than the maximum value representable by an integer, `avpriv_dnxhd_get_frame_size` might return a value that causes an integer overflow when assigned to `dctx->remaining`. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow in arithmetic.","The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `dctx->remaining` calculation. Specifically, the line `dctx->remaining -= buf_size;` could lead to a negative value if `buf_size` is larger than `dctx->remaining`. This could cause unexpected behavior and potentially lead to a crash or incorrect frame size calculation."
"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Uncontrolled use of integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow attackers to exploit the program.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating `dctx->remaining`.
