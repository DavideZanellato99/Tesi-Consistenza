"1","True","CWE-398","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a program accesses memory after it has been freed.","The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If `crypto_ahash_import` fails, `sock_orphan(sk2)` is called, which detaches the socket `sk2` from its parent socket `sk`. Subsequently, `sock_put(sk2)` releases the socket. If the caller later attempts to use `sk2`, a use-after-free error will occur."
"2","True","CWE-398","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a program accesses memory after that memory has been freed.","The code contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If `crypto_ahash_import` fails, `sock_orphan(sk2)` is called, which detaches `newsock` from `sk2`. Subsequently, `sock_put(sk2)` releases the socket. If `newsock` is later accessed (e.g., by a caller), it will be a dangling pointer, leading to a use-after-free."
