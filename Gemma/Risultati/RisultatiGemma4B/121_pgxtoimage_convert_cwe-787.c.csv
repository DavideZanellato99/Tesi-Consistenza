"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper handling of values resulting in an integer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of `cmptparm.w` and `cmptparm.h` due to the multiplication and addition operations involving `w`, `h`, and `parameters->subsampling_dx` and `parameters->subsampling_dy`.  If `w` and `h` are large, or `parameters->subsampling_dx` and `parameters->subsampling_dy` are large, the result of these calculations can exceed the maximum value of `OPJ_UINT32`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can cause incorrect image dimensions, potentially leading to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior."
