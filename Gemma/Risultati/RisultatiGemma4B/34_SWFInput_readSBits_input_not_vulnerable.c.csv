"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper manipulation of values of integer variables due to insufficient size or type.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. If `number` is greater than or equal to 32, the expression `(1 << (number - 1))` can result in a value that exceeds the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an incorrect comparison and potentially an incorrect return value. The `num & (1<<(number-1))` check is intended to detect this overflow, but it's not sufficient to prevent it."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Improper manipulation of values of integer variables due to incorrect mathematical operations.","The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. If `number` is greater than or equal to 32, the expression `(1 << (number - 1))` can result in a value that exceeds the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an incorrect comparison and potentially an incorrect return value.
