"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities by providing unexpected or malicious input, leading to unexpected program behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The `key` string is constructed using `strlen(hostname) + 1 + port_str.length()`, which is not properly validated. If `hostname` or `port_str` contains format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, `%n`), they will be interpreted by the `printf` function (implicitly used by `String` constructor) when `key` is later used in a format string operation. This could lead to information disclosure, arbitrary memory writes, or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Improper input validation can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This includes insufficient input validation, improper input validation, or failure to properly sanitize user input.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability.
