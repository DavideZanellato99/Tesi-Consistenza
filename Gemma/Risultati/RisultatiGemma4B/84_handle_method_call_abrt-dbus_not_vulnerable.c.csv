"1","True","CWE-399","Unexpected Denial of Service","An unexpected denial of service condition. This can occur when a program unexpectedly fails or hangs, causing it to become unresponsive or consume excessive resources.","The code contains a potential race condition and a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the `DeleteProblem` method uses `dd_delete` which can block indefinitely if the directory is locked. Additionally, the `ChownProblemDir` method can be exploited by a malicious caller to potentially cause a denial-of-service by triggering a long-running `dd_chown` operation. The `FindProblemByElementInTimeRange` method could be abused to cause a denial of service by requesting a large number of directories. The `SetElement` method could be abused to cause a denial of service by requesting a large number of directories."
"2","True","CWE-399","Unexpected Denial of Service","An unexpected denial of service condition. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a resource exhaustion, a deadlock, or a timeout.","The code contains a potential race condition and a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the `DeleteProblem` method uses `dd_delete` which can block indefinitely if the directory is locked. Additionally, the `DeleteElement` method can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by filling up the disk space allocated for storing problem data. The `FindProblemByElementInTimeRange` method could be abused to cause a denial of service by requesting a large number of elements. The `ChownProblemDir` method also has a potential race condition if the caller attempts to change the ownership of a directory while another process is accessing it."
"3","True","CWE-399","Unexpected Denial of Service","A denial-of-service vulnerability occurs when a program or system is made unavailable, rendering it unable to perform its intended function. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including resource exhaustion, excessive memory consumption, or infinite loops. </OUTPUT FORMAT>","The code contains a potential race condition and a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the `DeleteProblem` method uses `dd_delete` which can block indefinitely if the directory is locked or if there are issues with the underlying filesystem.  Furthermore, the `DeleteElement` method can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by attempting to delete a large number of elements in a single call, potentially exhausting system resources. The `FindProblemByElementInTimeRange` method also has a potential race condition if the caller is not authorized."
"4","True","CWE-399","Unexpected Denial of Service","An unexpected denial of service condition. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including resource exhaustion, deadlocks, or other unexpected behavior.","The code contains a potential race condition and a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the `DeleteProblem` method uses `dd_delete` which can block indefinitely if the directory is locked or if there are issues with the underlying filesystem.  Furthermore, the `DeleteElement` method can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by attempting to delete a large number of elements in a single call, potentially exhausting system resources. The `FindProblemByElementInTimeRange` method also has a potential race condition if the `get_problem_dirs_for_element_in_time` function is not properly synchronized. The `ChownProblemDir` method also has a potential race condition if the `dd_chown` function is not properly synchronized."
"5","True","CWE-398","Design Flaw - Information Exposure","A design flaw that exposes sensitive information. This can occur when information is exposed in a way that is not intended or is not properly protected.","The code contains a potential race condition and a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the `DeleteProblem` method uses `dd_delete` which can block indefinitely if the directory is locked. Additionally, the `SetElement` method checks the size of the element to be added, but it doesn't properly handle potential integer overflows when calculating the requested size. This could lead to a denial-of-service if a large value is provided, causing the program to hang while attempting to allocate memory. The `FindProblemByElementInTimeRange` method also has a potential race condition."
