"1","True","CWE-119","Improper Resource Cleanup","Failure to release resources when an error occurs.","The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability where an error during the allocation of `big_key_skcipher` or `big_key_rng` leads to the `error_rng` label being executed, which then calls `crypto_free_rng(big_key_rng)` before `crypto_free_skcipher(big_key_skcipher)`. This can result in a double-free error, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior."
"2","True","CWE-119","Improper Resource Cleanup","Failure to release limited resources properly.","The code attempts to allocate and register a key type, but if the `register_key_type` function fails, the allocated `skcipher` and `rng` structures are not freed. This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion."
"3","True","CWE-171","Improper Error Handling","Failure to properly handle errors can lead to unexpected program termination, memory leaks, or other unexpected behavior.","The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability where an error during the allocation of `big_key_skcipher` or `big_key_rng` leads to the `error_rng` label being unconditionally jumped to, potentially bypassing the `crypto_free_skcipher(big_key_skcipher)` call. This could result in memory leaks if `big_key_skcipher` was successfully allocated but not freed due to the error."
"4","True","CWE-119","Improper Resource Cleanup","Failure to release resources when an error occurs.","The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability where an error during the allocation of `big_key_skcipher` or `big_key_rng` leads to the `error_rng` label being executed, which then calls `crypto_free_rng(big_key_rng)` before `crypto_free_skcipher(big_key_skcipher)`.

"5","True","CWE-175","Improper Error Handling","Failure to properly handle errors can lead to unexpected program termination, memory leaks, or other unexpected behavior.","The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability where an error during the allocation of `big_key_skcipher` or `big_key_rng` leads to the `error_rng` label being unconditionally jumped to, potentially bypassing the `crypto_free_skcipher(big_key_skcipher)` and `crypto_free_rng(big_key_rng)` cleanup steps. This could result in memory leaks if the allocation fails and the cleanup is skipped."
