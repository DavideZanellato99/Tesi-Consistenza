"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value. This can occur when performing arithmetic operations that exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum value that the variable can hold.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `r` for `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE`. Specifically, `(threads_per_subcore << 1) - 1` can result in an integer overflow if `threads_per_subcore` is large enough, leading to a negative value being assigned to `r`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues depending on how `r` is subsequently used."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Integer constants or expressions are not validated to ensure that their values are within the range of the data type. This can lead to integer overflow or wraparound, which can cause unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `threads_per_subcore` without proper validation. If `threads_per_subcore` is not initialized or is set to an unexpectedly large value, it can lead to integer overflow or other unexpected behavior when used in calculations, particularly in the `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT` and `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE` cases. This can potentially lead to denial of service or other security issues."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value.

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value.
