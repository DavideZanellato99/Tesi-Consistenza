"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or offset that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads `partNumber` from the input stream using `OPENEXR_IMF_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE::Xdr::read`. The code then uses `partNumber` as an index into the `parts` vector: `Header& header = parts[partNumber]->header;`. There is no bounds checking on `partNumber` before using it as an index. If `partNumber` is negative or greater than or equal to `parts.size()`, this will result in an out-of-bounds access, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."

The code then uses `partNumber` as an index into the `parts` vector: `Header& header = parts[partNumber]->header;`. There is no bounds checking on `partNumber` before using it as an index. If the value read from the stream is out of range (e.g., greater than or equal to `parts.size()`), this will lead to an out-of-bounds access, potentially causing a crash or arbitrary code execution. The code does check `partNumber<0 || partNumber>= static_cast<int>(parts.size())` but only after reading the value from the stream. This check is insufficient because the cast to `int` could lead to integer overflow if the value read from the stream is a large positive number."
