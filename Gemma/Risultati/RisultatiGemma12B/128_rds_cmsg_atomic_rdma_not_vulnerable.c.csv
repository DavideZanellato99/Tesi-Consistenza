"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from outside the bounds of a buffer.","The code performs an integer check `if (args->local_addr & 0x7)` to verify 8-byte alignment. However, `args->local_addr` is obtained from user space via a control message. If a malicious user provides an unaligned address, the check will pass, and `rds_pin_pages` will be called with this unaligned address. `offset_in_page` is then used to calculate the offset within the page, which could lead to out-of-bounds memory access when `sg_set_page` is called."
"2","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code uses `sg_set_page` to set the scatter-gather list entry. The offset is calculated as `offset_in_page(args->local_addr)`. If `args->local_addr` is not properly validated, it could lead to an out-of-bounds access when calculating the offset. Specifically, if `args->local_addr` is greater than or equal to the page size (4096 bytes), `offset_in_page` will return a large value, potentially causing `sg_set_page` to write beyond the bounds of the allocated page. The check `if (args->local_addr & 0x7)` only ensures 8-byte alignment, but does not prevent `args->local_addr` from being larger than the page size."
