"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses `strlen(hostname)` to determine the size of the `key` string before copying `hostname` into it. However, `hostname` is obtained from `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME(instance)`, which is documented to return a pointer to a string allocated by the memcached library. This string might be larger than expected, leading to a buffer overflow when copying it into the `key` string. The `ReserveString` constructor allocates `key_len` bytes, but if `hostname` is longer than `key_len - 1` (accounting for the colon and port string), a buffer overflow will occur."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses `strlen(hostname)` to calculate the required buffer size for the `key` string, but it doesn't account for the null terminator that `hostname` might already contain. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `hostname` is not null-terminated, as `strlen` will return the length without the null terminator, and the `String(key_len, ReserveString)` constructor will allocate a buffer one byte too small."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses `strlen(hostname)` to calculate the required buffer size for the `key` string, but it doesn't check if the calculated size is sufficient to hold the entire string including the colon and the port string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `hostname` is very long."
"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses `strlen(hostname)` to calculate the required buffer size for the `key` string, but it doesn't account for the null terminator that `strlen` counts. This leads to a buffer overflow when `key += hostname` is called, as the allocated buffer is one byte too small."
"5","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","A null pointer is dereferenced, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.","The code uses `memcached_stat` to retrieve statistics, but it doesn't check if the returned `stats` pointer is null before dereferencing it in the loop. If `memcached_stat` returns an error, `stats` will be null, leading to a segmentation fault when `stat = stats + server_id;` is executed."
