"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute values that are too large to be stored in the data type. The result wraps around, leading to incorrect results.","The code uses `xasprintf` to create the `problem_id` string. While `xasprintf` is intended to prevent buffer overflows, it's used with a format string that includes `tv.tv_usec` and `getpid()`, which are cast to `long`. If `tv.tv_usec` or `getpid()` are sufficiently large, the resulting `long` value might exceed the maximum value that can be safely represented as a `long`, leading to integer overflow. This overflow can result in a smaller value being used in the format string, potentially causing `xasprintf` to allocate a smaller buffer than needed, leading to a buffer overflow when the string is constructed."
