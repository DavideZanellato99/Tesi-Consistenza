"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `LY_TYPE_INST` case. The `lyxp_parse_expr` function parses an expression, and the code iterates through the tokens of the expression, copying parts of the expression into the `buf` buffer. The code checks if the total length of the copied string exceeds `buf_len`, but the check is performed after the `strncpy` calls, which can write past the end of the buffer if the calculated length is incorrect. Specifically, the `count` variable is used to track the current length of the string in `buf`, but it's not updated correctly in all cases, leading to potential overflows."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.
