"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The `snprintf` function is used to format a string into the destination buffer `dest`. If the formatted string is longer than `destlen`, `snprintf` will not truncate the string, leading to a buffer overflow. The code doesn't check the return value of `snprintf` to ensure that the output was not truncated."
