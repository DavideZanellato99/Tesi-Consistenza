"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Produced by a Web Application ('Injection')","The software uses unvalidated input to construct commands or queries. This can allow attackers to inject arbitrary commands or queries, leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.","The code reads image data from the file using `readuchar`, `readushort`, and `readuint` functions, which are not defined in the provided snippet. This implies that these functions are externally defined and potentially vulnerable. If these functions do not perform proper bounds checking when reading from the file, a malicious file could cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues. The code also uses `fscanf` to parse the header, which is susceptible to format string vulnerabilities if the input file is crafted maliciously."
"2","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output","The code uses `fscanf` to parse the header of the PGX file. If the input file is not properly controlled, an attacker could craft a malicious file that exploits format string vulnerabilities in `fscanf`, leading to arbitrary code execution.","The code reads image data from the file using `readuchar`, `readushort`, and `readuint` functions, which are not defined in the provided snippet.
