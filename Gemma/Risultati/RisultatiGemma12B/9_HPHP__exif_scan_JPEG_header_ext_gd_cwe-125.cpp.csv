"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations could cause an integer overflow or wraparound condition. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.","The code reads the length of a JPEG section using `ImageInfo->infile->getc()` twice, storing the values in `lh` and `ll`. It then calculates `itemlen = (lh << 8) | ll;`.  If `lh` or `ll` are unexpectedly large, this could lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a very small `itemlen`. Subsequently, `ImageInfo->infile->read(itemlen-2)` attempts to read a number of bytes based on this potentially incorrect `itemlen`. If `itemlen` is small, `itemlen-2` could be negative, leading to undefined behavior or a crash when passed to `read`."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute large values that exceed the maximum representable value for the data type. When this occurs, the value wraps around to a smaller value, leading to incorrect results.","The code reads the length of a JPEG section using `ImageInfo->infile->getc()` twice, storing the values in `lh` and `ll`. It then calculates `itemlen = (lh << 8) | ll;`.  If `lh` or `ll` are unexpectedly large, this could lead to an integer overflow when calculating `itemlen`. This overflowed `itemlen` is then used in `ImageInfo->infile->read(itemlen-2)`, potentially causing the program to read beyond the intended bounds of the file, leading to a buffer overflow."
