"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet is part of a PHP extension and primarily registers classes and their interfaces within the Zend Engine. It uses `memcpy` to copy object handlers, which is a common and safe practice in this context. There are no apparent memory safety issues or other vulnerabilities."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet is part of a PHP extension initialization function. It registers various classes and their interfaces related to array handling. The use of memcpy to copy object handlers is a standard practice in PHP extensions for inheritance and code reuse. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities."
