"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the `ares_expand_name` function within the loop. Specifically, the `aptr + rr_len` check within the loop doesn't prevent `aptr` from exceeding the bounds of `abuf` if `rr_len` is larger than the remaining data in `abuf`. This can lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting memory or triggering a crash."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. Specifically, within the loop iterating through answer resource records (RR), the `ares_expand_name` function is called to decode the RR data for CNAME records. The decoded data is assigned to `hostname` without checking its length. If the decoded data is larger than the allocated buffer for `hostname`, a heap buffer overflow occurs."
