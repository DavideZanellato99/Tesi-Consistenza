"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from an input source to a destination buffer without verifying the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function. Specifically, `memcpy(ctxt->fetch.data, insn, insn_len);` copies `insn_len` bytes from `insn` to `ctxt->fetch.data`. If `insn_len` is sufficiently large, it could lead to a buffer overflow in `ctxt->fetch.data`. The size of `ctxt->fetch.data` is determined by `ctxt->fetch.data + insn_len`, but there's no explicit size check before the `memcpy` call."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function. If `insn_len` is sufficiently large, it could lead to a buffer overflow. Specifically, `memcpy(ctxt->fetch.data, insn, insn_len);` copies `insn_len` bytes from `insn` to `ctxt->fetch.data`. If `insn_len` is greater than the allocated size of `ctxt->fetch.data`, a buffer overflow occurs."

Specifically, `memcpy(ctxt->fetch.data, insn, insn_len);` copies `insn_len` bytes from `insn` to `ctxt->fetch.data`.
