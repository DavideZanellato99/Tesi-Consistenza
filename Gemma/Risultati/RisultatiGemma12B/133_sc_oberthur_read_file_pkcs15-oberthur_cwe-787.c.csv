"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data types can result in overflow or wraparound, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `sz` when `file->ef_structure` is not `SC_FILE_EF_TRANSPARENT`. Specifically, `sz = (file->record_length + 2) * file->record_count;` can overflow if `file->record_length + 2` and `file->record_count` are large enough. This overflow can lead to `sz` being a small value, resulting in a buffer that is too small to hold the data read from the file. This can lead to a heap buffer overflow when `calloc(sz, 1)` allocates memory and `sc_read_record` attempts to write data into it."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data may result in a value that is too large to be stored in the data type, leading to an overflow.
