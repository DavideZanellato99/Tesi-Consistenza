"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `memcpy` function copies `bitmapData->bitmapLength` bytes from the stream to `bitmapData->bitmapDataStream`. If `bitmapData->bitmapLength` is larger than the allocated size of `bitmapData->bitmapDataStream`, a buffer overflow will occur. The check `Stream_GetRemainingLength(s) < bitmapData->bitmapLength` only checks if there are enough bytes in the stream, but not if the length is larger than the allocated buffer."
