"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data types can result in overflow or wraparound, leading to unexpected results.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `Stream_Read_UINT16` calls for `iconInfo->width` and `iconInfo->height`. If the stream contains a value that, when interpreted as a `UINT16`, exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `UINT16` (65535), it will wrap around, leading to an incorrect value being assigned. This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access or other unexpected behavior later in the program."
