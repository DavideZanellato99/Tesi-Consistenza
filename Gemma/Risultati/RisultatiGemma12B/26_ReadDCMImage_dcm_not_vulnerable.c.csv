"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `MagickPathExtent` for string copies without checking the length of the source string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than `MagickPathExtent - 1`. Specifically, `CopyMagickString` and `ConcatenateString` are vulnerable."
