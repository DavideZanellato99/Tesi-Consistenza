"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `ReadBlob` to read data from the input stream without proper bounds checking. Specifically, in the main loop, the `length` variable determines how many bytes to read, but this `length` is derived from potentially untrusted data within the DICOM file. If a malicious DICOM file provides a very large `length` value, `ReadBlob` could attempt to read beyond the bounds of the input stream, leading to a buffer overflow or denial-of-service. The `ReadBlob` function itself might not be vulnerable, but the logic that determines the size of the read operation is flawed."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or offset that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code uses `ReadBlob` to read data from the input stream without proper bounds checking. Specifically, in the main loop, the `ReadBlob` calls within the `switch` statement for different DICOM elements do not validate the `length` variable against the actual size of the data being read. If `length` is larger than the remaining data in the blob, `ReadBlob` will attempt to read beyond the end of the stream, leading to a buffer over-read. This can result in arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

Specifically, in the main loop, the `ReadBlob` calls within the `switch` statement for different DICOM elements do not validate the `length` variable against the actual size of the data being read. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `length` is larger than the available data in the stream, potentially overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer. The `ReadBlobLSBShort`, `ReadBlobLSBSignedShort`, `ReadBlobLSBSignedLong`, `ReadBlobSignedShort`, and `ReadBlobSignedLong` functions are also vulnerable to similar issues."
