"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `inflate` function can write past the end of the buffer pointed to by `zstream.next_out` if the compressed data is crafted maliciously. The `buf_size` variable is used to determine the size of the buffer, but `inflate` is not guaranteed to write exactly `buf_size - 1` bytes. If `inflate` writes more than `buf_size - 1` bytes, it will overflow the buffer."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `inflate` function writes data into the buffer pointed to by `zstream.next_out`, which is obtained from `av_bprint_get_buffer`. If `inflate` writes more data than `buf_size - 1`, it will overflow the buffer. The check `if (buf_size < 2)` only prevents allocation of a buffer smaller than 2 bytes, but it doesn't prevent `inflate` from writing past the end of the allocated buffer."
