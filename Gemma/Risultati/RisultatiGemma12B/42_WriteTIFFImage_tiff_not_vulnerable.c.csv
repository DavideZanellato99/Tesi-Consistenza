"1","True","CWE-778","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output","The software uses external input (option) to construct output without properly validating or sanitizing it. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities, where malicious input can be interpreted as commands or code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution. In this case, the incorrect comparison can lead to a malformed TIFF file.","The code uses `LocaleNCompare` to compare strings, but doesn't check the return value. If `LocaleNCompare` returns a negative value (indicating the first string is less than the second), the code proceeds as if the comparison was successful, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the `endian` handling, if `LocaleNCompare(option,""msb"",3)` returns a negative value, the code will still execute `endian_type=MSBEndian;`. This can lead to incorrect endianness being set, potentially corrupting the TIFF file."
