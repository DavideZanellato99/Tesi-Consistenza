"1","True","CWE-415","Use-After-Free","A program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","A use-after-free vulnerability exists. The `c_net` variable is read using `read_pnet(&tc->conn->c_net)` within the spin lock. If the `net` parameter does not match `c_net`, the `tc` structure is moved to the `tmp_list`. Later, when iterating through `tmp_list`, `tc->t_sock` and `tc->conn` are accessed. If the original `net` has been freed or otherwise invalidated before this point, accessing `tc->t_sock->sk` or `tc->conn->c_passive` will result in a use-after-free."
"2","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","A program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.","A use-after-free vulnerability exists. The `c_net` variable is read using `read_pnet(&tc->conn->c_net)`, which could return a pointer to a freed `net` structure if `tc->conn->c_net` is invalid. Subsequently, `rds_conn_destroy(tc->conn)` and `rds_conn_destroy(tc->conn->c_passive)` are called, potentially freeing memory while the `c_net` pointer is still in use."
