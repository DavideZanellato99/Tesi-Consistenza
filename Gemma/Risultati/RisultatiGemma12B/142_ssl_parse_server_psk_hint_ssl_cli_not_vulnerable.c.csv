"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from an input source to a destination buffer without verifying the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code checks if (*p) > end - 2 before reading the length of the PSK identity hint. However, it doesn't check if len is greater than the remaining bytes after reading the length. This can lead to a buffer overflow when copying the PSK identity hint."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code checks if (*p) > end - 2 before reading the length of the PSK identity hint. However, it doesn't check if len is greater than the remaining buffer size before reading the hint data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if len is larger than end - *p."
