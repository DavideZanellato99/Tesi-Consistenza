"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses a fixed-size buffer `state` to store the hash context state. The size of this buffer is determined by `crypto_ahash_statesize(crypto_ahash_reqtfm(req))`. If the underlying cryptographic algorithm requires a state size larger than the allocated buffer, a buffer overflow will occur during the `crypto_ahash_export` call."
