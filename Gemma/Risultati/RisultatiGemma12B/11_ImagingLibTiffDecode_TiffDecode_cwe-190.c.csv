"1","True","CWE-233","Reliance on Predictable Filenames","The software relies on a predictable filename, which can be exploited by an attacker to create a malicious file that is processed by the software.","The code uses a hardcoded filename ""tempfile.tif"". This filename is passed to TIFFClientOpen, which could lead to a denial-of-service if a malicious actor can control the environment and create a file with that name containing specially crafted TIFF data. This crafted data could trigger unexpected behavior or crashes within the TIFF parsing library."
"2","True","CWE-23","Path Traversal","Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when software improperly validates user-supplied input that is used to construct a file path. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to access files and directories that are not intended to be accessible.","The code uses a hardcoded filename ""tempfile.tif"". This filename is passed to TIFFClientOpen, which could lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability if a malicious actor can control the contents of this file. Specifically, if a specially crafted TIFF file is placed at this location, it could cause the TIFF parsing library to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service."
"3","True","CWE-23","Hardcoded Filename or Path","A hard-coded filename or path is used in the application. This can be exploited by an attacker who can place a malicious file at the hard-coded location, leading to denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.","The code uses a hardcoded filename ""tempfile.tif"". This filename is passed to TIFFClientOpen, which could lead to a denial-of-service if a malicious actor can control the environment and create a file with that name containing specially crafted TIFF data. This could cause the TIFF library to crash or consume excessive resources."
"4","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software performs pathname operations without properly validating the pathname. This can allow attackers to access files or directories that are not intended to be accessible.","The code uses a fixed filename ""tempfile.tif"" when opening the TIFF file. This filename is used in `TIFFClientOpen`, which could lead to a denial-of-service if a malicious TIFF file with that name exists in a location accessible to the application. An attacker could create a large or specially crafted ""tempfile.tif"" to exhaust resources or cause the application to crash."
"5","True","CWE-233","Reliance on Predictable Filenames","The software relies on a predictable filename, which can be exploited by an attacker to create a malicious file that is processed by the software.","The code uses a hardcoded filename ""tempfile.tif"". This filename is passed to TIFFClientOpen, which could lead to a denial-of-service if a malicious actor can control the environment and create a file with that name containing specially crafted TIFF data. This crafted data could trigger unexpected behavior or crashes within the TIFF parsing library."
