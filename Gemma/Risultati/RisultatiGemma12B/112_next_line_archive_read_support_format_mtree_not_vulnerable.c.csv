"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing it to wrap around to a minimum value.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `nbytes_req`. Specifically, `*ravail+1023` can overflow if `*ravail` is close to the maximum value of `ssize_t`. The subsequent bitwise AND operation `& ~1023U` might not produce the expected result due to the overflow, leading to an incorrect value for `nbytes_req`. This could cause the program to request an excessively large amount of data from `__archive_read_ahead`, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or memory exhaustion."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During calculations, a number can exceed the maximum or minimum value that the data type can hold. When this occurs, the value wraps around to the other end of the range.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `nbytes_req`. Specifically, `*ravail + 1023` can overflow if `*ravail` is close to the maximum value of `ssize_t`. The subsequent bitwise AND operation `& ~1023U` might not produce the intended result due to the overflow, leading to an unexpectedly small value for `nbytes_req`. This can cause the program to read insufficient data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service."
