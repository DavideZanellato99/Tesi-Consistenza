"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value. This can occur when performing arithmetic operations that exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum value that the variable can hold.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `r` for `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE`. Specifically, `(threads_per_subcore << 1) - 1` can result in an integer overflow if `threads_per_subcore` is large enough, leading to a negative value being assigned to `r`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues depending on how the returned value is used."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value. This can result in unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `r` for `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE`.

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing it to wrap around to a minimum value.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `r` for `KVM_CAP_PPC_SMT_POSSIBLE`. Specifically, `threads_per_subcore` is multiplied by 2 and then 1 is subtracted. If `threads_per_subcore` is sufficiently large, the multiplication could result in an integer overflow, leading to a negative value. This negative value is then used in a conditional statement, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities."
