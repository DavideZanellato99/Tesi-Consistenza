"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);` line copies `label_len` bytes from the packet to the `name_out` buffer. The code checks `if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;` before the memcpy, but this check is insufficient. If `label_len` is close to `name_out_len`, the subsequent `*cp = '\0';` can write past the end of the buffer, leading to a heap overflow."
