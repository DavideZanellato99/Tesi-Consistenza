"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from one location to another without verifying the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code copies data from `apdu.resp` to `out` using `memcpy`. The size of the copy is determined by `len - offset`, where `len` is the maximum size of the output buffer (`outlen`) and `apdu.resplen`, and `offset` is calculated based on the contents of `apdu.resp`. If `offset` is not correctly calculated or if the contents of `apdu.resp` are manipulated to cause a large `offset` value, a buffer overflow can occur when copying data into `out`. Specifically, if `offset` is close to `len`, the amount of data copied can exceed `outlen`, leading to a buffer overflow."

The size of the copy is determined by `len - offset`, where `len` is the maximum size of the output buffer `outlen` and `offset` is calculated based on the contents of `apdu.resp`. If `offset` is not correctly calculated, it could lead to a buffer overflow if `len - offset` exceeds the size of the output buffer `out`. Specifically, the while loop calculating offset could potentially lead to an infinite loop if `apdu.resp[offset]` never equals 0, or it could result in `offset` being equal to `len`, causing `memcpy` to copy 0 bytes, which is not necessarily an error, but it could be unexpected behavior. However, the more critical vulnerability is the potential for `len - offset` to be greater than `outlen`, leading to a buffer overflow."
