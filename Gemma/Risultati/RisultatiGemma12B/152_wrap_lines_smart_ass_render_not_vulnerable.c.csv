"1","True","CWE-399","Resource Management Error","A lack of proper resource management can lead to memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other problems. This often occurs when resources are allocated but not freed, or when resources are freed without proper cleanup.","The code uses `realloc` to resize the `text_info->lines` array. However, it doesn't check if `realloc` returns NULL, which can lead to a crash if memory allocation fails. If `realloc` fails, `text_info->lines` becomes NULL, and subsequent dereferences of `text_info->lines` will result in a segmentation fault."

"4","True","CWE-399","Resource Exhaustion","The code attempts to allocate memory using `realloc` but does not check for allocation failure.

However, it doesn't check if `realloc` returns NULL. If `realloc` fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), it returns NULL, and the code proceeds to dereference this NULL pointer in the subsequent `if (lead < text_info->length)` block, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
