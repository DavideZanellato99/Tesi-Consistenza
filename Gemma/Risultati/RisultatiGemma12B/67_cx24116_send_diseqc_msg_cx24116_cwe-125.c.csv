"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data types can result in overflow or wraparound, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `msleep()` with a calculated delay based on `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` and `toneburst`. If `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` is sufficiently large, the delay calculated in `msleep((state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN] << 4) + ...)` can exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`, leading to integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative delay being passed to `msleep()`, which is undefined behavior and potentially a denial-of-service vulnerability if the kernel handles negative sleep values unexpectedly."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute large values that exceed the maximum representable value for the data type. When this occurs, the value wraps around to a smaller value, leading to incorrect results.","The code uses `msleep()` with a calculated delay based on `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` and `toneburst`. If `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` is sufficiently large, the delay calculated in `msleep((state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN] << 4) + ...)` can exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`, leading to integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative delay being passed to `msleep()`, which is undefined behavior and could lead to a denial of service or other unexpected behavior. The validation `d->msg_len > (CX24116_ARGLEN - CX24116_DISEQC_MSGOFS)` only prevents buffer overflows, not integer overflows in the delay calculation."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer values can overflow, leading to unexpected results. Integer overflow can occur when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be stored in the integer data type. This can lead to incorrect program behavior, security vulnerabilities, or denial of service.","The code uses `msleep()` with a calculated delay based on `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` and `toneburst`. If `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` is sufficiently large, the calculated delay can exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`, leading to integer overflow. This overflow results in a negative delay being passed to `msleep()`, which is undefined behavior and can lead to the kernel hanging or other unpredictable behavior."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute large values that exceed the maximum representable value for the data type.

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","Integer overflows and Wraparounds can occur when arithmetic operations exceed the maximum value that a data type can hold. These overflows can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, and security vulnerabilities.","The code calculates the sleep duration based on `state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN]` and `toneburst`. Specifically, the line `msleep((state->dsec_cmd.args[CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN] << 4) + ((toneburst == CX24116_DISEQC_TONEOFF) ? 30 : 60));` is vulnerable. `CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN` stores the length of the DiSEqC message, which is validated earlier to be less than `CX24116_ARGLEN - CX24116_DISEQC_MSGOFS`. However, the value is then left-shifted by 4 and added to a constant. If `CX24116_DISEQC_MSGLEN` is sufficiently large, the resulting value could overflow, leading to a very small sleep duration or even a negative sleep duration. While `msleep` might handle negative values gracefully, a very small sleep duration could lead to timing issues and potentially denial of service."
