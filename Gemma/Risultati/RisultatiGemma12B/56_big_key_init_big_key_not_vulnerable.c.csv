"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet allocates and initializes a random number generator (RNG) and a block cipher. Error handling is present for allocation failures and seeding the RNG. Resources are properly freed in case of errors. The code does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be correctly allocating, initializing, and registering cryptographic resources. Error handling is present for allocation failures and other operations, and resources are freed appropriately in case of errors. There are no immediately apparent vulnerabilities."
