"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or arbitrary code execution.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `PT_STRING8` case. The code checks if the length of the string data matches the allocated size (`mapidata->size`). However, it doesn't account for the null terminator. If `mapidata->size` does not include space for the null terminator, `strlen` will read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
