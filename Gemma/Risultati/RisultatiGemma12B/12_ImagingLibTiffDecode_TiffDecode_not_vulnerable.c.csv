"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software does not sufficiently validate or sanitize user-supplied input that is used to construct a pathname. As a result, an attacker can manipulate the pathname to access files or directories outside the intended restricted area.","The code uses a fixed filename ""tempfile.tif"" when opening the TIFF file. If a file with this name already exists in the current working directory, it could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption. This is a form of resource management issue where the code doesn't properly handle the existence of a pre-existing file."

"5","True","CWE-233","Pointed or Uncontrolled File Descriptor","A program uses a file descriptor that is pointed to by user-controlled input, or that is otherwise uncontrolled. This can allow an attacker to cause a denial of service, or to gain control of the program.","The code uses a fixed filename ""tempfile.tif"" when opening the TIFF file. If a file with this name already exists in the current working directory, it could lead to a denial-of-service or data corruption if the existing file is not a valid TIFF image or is in an unexpected format. This is a form of resource exhaustion or unexpected behavior due to external factors."
