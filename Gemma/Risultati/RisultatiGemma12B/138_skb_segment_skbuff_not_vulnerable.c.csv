"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute large values that exceed the maximum value that can be stored in the data type. When this occurs, the value wraps around to a smaller value, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `if (hsize > len || !sg)` condition. If `hsize` is a large positive number and `len` is a small negative number (due to potential underflow in `len = head_skb->len - offset;`), the condition `hsize > len` will always be true, regardless of the actual values. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially a crash. Specifically, the code might proceed with calculations using an incorrect `hsize` value, leading to memory corruption or other issues."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect value. This can result in incorrect program behavior, including memory corruption, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected program termination.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `if (hsize > len || !sg)` condition. If `hsize` is a large positive number and `len` is a small negative number (due to potential underflow in `len = head_skb->len - offset;`), the condition `hsize > len` will always be true, regardless of the actual values. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially a crash. Specifically, the code might proceed with an invalid `hsize` value, leading to memory corruption or other issues."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an unexpected and potentially exploitable value.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `if (hsize > len || !sg)` condition.
