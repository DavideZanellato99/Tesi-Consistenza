"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `memcpy` calls `memcpy(newData + newpos, diffPtr, x);` and `memcpy(newData + newpos, extraPtr, y);` do not perform sufficient bounds checking before copying data into `newData`. Specifically, the checks `newpos + x > newDataLength` and `newpos + y > newDataLength` only check if the copy would exceed the allocated size of `newData`, but they do not prevent the copy from overflowing the buffer if `newpos` is close to `newDataLength` and `x` or `y` are large enough. This can lead to writing past the end of the allocated memory, resulting in a heap buffer overflow."
