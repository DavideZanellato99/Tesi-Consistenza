"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Under-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads data from `data` using `UINT` without checking array bounds. Specifically, within the loop `for (cur_case = 0; cur_case <= max_val - min_val; pos += 4, cur_case++)`, the condition `pos + 4 >= len` checks if there's enough data remaining, but `R_BIN_JAVA_UINT (data, pos)` can still read out of bounds if `pos + 4` is greater than `len`. This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads data from `data` using `UINT` without checking array bounds. Specifically, within the `if (max_val > min_val && ((max_val - min_val)<(UT16_MAX/4)))` block, the loop `pos += 4, cur_case++` increments `pos` and reads `data[pos]` and `data[pos+4]` in each iteration. The condition `pos + 4 >= len` checks if the read goes beyond the length of the data, but it's only checked *after* the access. This can lead to a buffer over-read if `pos + 4` exceeds `len`."
