"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, resulting in an incorrect value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect comparisons, and other security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while` loops that increment `*end`. If the input string `str` is very long, the `*end` pointer can increment beyond the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer over-read when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an unexpected and incorrect value. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service, or in some cases, to execute arbitrary code.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while` loops that increment `*end`. If the input string `str` is very long, the `*end` pointer can increment beyond the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer over-read when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"3","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while` loops that increment `*end`. If the input string `str` is very long, the `*end` pointer can increment beyond the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer over-read when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing an overflow. The result is often truncated or wrapped around to a lower value, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while` loops when incrementing `*end`. If the input string `str` is very long, the `*end` pointer can increment beyond the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer over-read when `str[*end]` is accessed."
"5","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while` loops that increment `*end`. If the input string `str` is very long, the `*end` pointer can increment beyond the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer over-read when `str[*end]` is accessed."
