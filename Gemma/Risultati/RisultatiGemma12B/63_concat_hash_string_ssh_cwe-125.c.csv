"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Destination Buffer","A buffer is copied from a source to a destination without verifying that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire contents of the source buffer.","The code uses `strncpy` without properly checking the size of the destination buffer `buf`. The `buf_out_len` variable is incremented, but it's not used to limit the number of bytes copied by `strncpy`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data being copied from `packet->payload` exceeds the available space in `buf`. The `buf_out_len` is not initialized with the size of `buf`, so it's possible to write past the end of the buffer."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses `strncpy` without properly checking the size of the destination buffer `buf`.
