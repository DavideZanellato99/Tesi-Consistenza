"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads data from `data` using `UINT` without checking array bounds. Specifically, within the `if (max_val > min_val && ((max_val - min_val)<(UT16_MAX/4)))` block, the loop `pos += 4, cur_case++` increments `pos` and reads `R_BIN_JAVA_UINT (data, pos)` within the loop. If `pos + 4 >= len` is not met, the code attempts to read beyond the bounds of the `data` array, leading to a buffer over-read."
