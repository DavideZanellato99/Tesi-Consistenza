"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Lack of validation or improper validation of input can allow attackers to manipulate the application, leading to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more.","The code uses `istreq` to compare strings, which is case-sensitive. If the input string is ""Any"" (capital 'A'), it will not be considered a match for ""any"", leading to unexpected behavior and potentially bypassing intended security checks."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","Failure to properly validate user-supplied input can allow attackers to inject arbitrary data into the system, leading to a variety of attacks such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.","The code uses `istreq` to compare strings, which is case-sensitive.
