"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses strcpy to copy strings into globtype without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is larger than the globtype buffer (size 12)."
