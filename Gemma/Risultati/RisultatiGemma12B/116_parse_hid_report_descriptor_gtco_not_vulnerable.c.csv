"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from one location to another without verifying the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code uses `strcpy` to copy strings into `globtype` without checking the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is larger than the `globtype` buffer (which is 12 bytes). Specifically, in the `TYPE_MAIN` switch case, `strcpy(globtype, """");` and `strcpy(globtype, ""Variable"");` and `strcpy(globtype, ""Var|Const"");` are vulnerable."

"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `strcpy` without checking the size of the input string, leading to a potential buffer overflow in `strcpy(globtype, ...)` and `strcpy(indentstr, ...)` within the `parse_hid_report_descriptor` function. The size of the destination buffers `globtype` and `indentstr` are fixed (12 and 10 respectively), but the size of the source strings is not validated before copying. This can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the buffers, potentially corrupting memory and leading to crashes or exploitable vulnerabilities."
