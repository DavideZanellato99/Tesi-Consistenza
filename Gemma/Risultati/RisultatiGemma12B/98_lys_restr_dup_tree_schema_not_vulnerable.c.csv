"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when a program writes past the end of a memory buffer allocated on the heap.","The code uses `calloc(size, sizeof *result)` to allocate memory for `result`. However, the loop iterates `size` times, and within the loop, `lys_ext_dup` is called, which might allocate more memory than initially allocated by `calloc`. If `lys_ext_dup` allocates more memory than the initial `calloc` size allows, a heap buffer overflow can occur."
