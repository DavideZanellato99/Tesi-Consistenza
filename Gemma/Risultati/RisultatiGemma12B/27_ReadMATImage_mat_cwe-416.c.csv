"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data types can result in a value that is too large to be stored in the data type, leading to an overflow. When an overflow occurs, the value wraps around to a minimum value, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while(!EOFBlob(image))` loop. Specifically, the line `filepos += MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize + 4 + 4;` can lead to an integer overflow if `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is sufficiently large. This overflow can cause `filepos` to wrap around to a small value, leading to incorrect file position calculations and potentially allowing the code to read beyond the bounds of the blob, resulting in a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues. The check `(MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image)` attempts to mitigate this, but it's not sufficient because the overflow has already occurred when calculating `filepos`."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","A program checks an integer value, such as an array index or a buffer size, but fails to verify that the value is within the valid range. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while(!EOFBlob(image))` loop. Specifically, the line `filepos += MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize + 4 + 4;` can lead to an integer overflow if `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is sufficiently large. This overflow can cause `filepos` to wrap around to a small value, leading to incorrect file position calculations and potentially allowing the code to read beyond the bounds of the blob, resulting in a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues. The check `(MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image)` attempts to mitigate this, but the overflow can still occur *before* this check is performed, making the mitigation ineffective."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing it to wrap around to a minimum value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `(MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image)`. If `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is a large value and `filepos` is also large, their sum could exceed the maximum value of `size_t`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow could result in a false comparison, allowing the code to proceed with potentially out-of-bounds memory access later in the function, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type. The result is truncated or wraps around, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `while(!EOFBlob(image))` loop. Specifically, the line `filepos += MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize + 4 + 4;` increments `filepos` by `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize + 8`. If `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is sufficiently large, adding 8 to it can cause an integer overflow. This overflow can lead to `filepos` wrapping around to a small value, potentially causing the code to read past the end of the blob or into unexpected memory regions, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
