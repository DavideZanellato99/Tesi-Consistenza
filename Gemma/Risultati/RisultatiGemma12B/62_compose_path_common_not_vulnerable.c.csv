"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `strlcat` and `strlcpy` without properly checking for buffer overflows. Specifically, the `strlcat` calls within the `if (path)` block and the `else` block after the `stat` call can lead to buffer overflows if the concatenated strings exceed `PATH_MAX`. The `memmove` call to remove ""//"" also has the potential to cause issues if the input string is crafted maliciously."
