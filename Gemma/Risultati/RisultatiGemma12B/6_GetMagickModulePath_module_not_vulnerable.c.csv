"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code concatenates the filename to the path using ConcatenateMagickString, which appears to be a custom function. The code does not perform any bounds checking when concatenating the filename to the path, leading to a potential buffer overflow if the filename is too long. The `MaxTextExtent` variable is used as a buffer size, but it's not checked before concatenation."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code concatenates the filename to the path using ConcatenateMagickString, which appears to be a custom function. The code does not perform any bounds checking when concatenating the filename to the path, leading to a potential buffer overflow in the `path` buffer, which has a fixed size of `MaxTextExtent`. The `IsPathAccessible` function is then called with this potentially overflowing path."
