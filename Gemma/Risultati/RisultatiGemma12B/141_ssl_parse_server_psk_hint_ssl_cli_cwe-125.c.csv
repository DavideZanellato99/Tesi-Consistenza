"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code checks if `(*p) > end - 2` before reading the length of the `psk_identity_hint`. However, it doesn't check if `len` is a reasonable value before accessing `(*p) + len`. If `len` is large enough, `(*p) + len` can exceed `end`, leading to a buffer over-read."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code checks if (*p) > end - 2 before reading the length of the psk_identity_hint. However, it doesn't check if len + *p > end before reading the hint data itself. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length is large enough."
