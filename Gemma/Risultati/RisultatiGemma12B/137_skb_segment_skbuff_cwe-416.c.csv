"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows or wraps around, resulting in an incorrect value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, and security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `if (pos + size > offset + len)` check within the inner loop. If `pos`, `size`, `offset`, and `len` are large enough, `pos + size` can wrap around, leading to a false positive and potentially causing the code to skip fragments or access memory out of bounds. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution."
