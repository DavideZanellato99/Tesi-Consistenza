"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer.","The code lacks bounds checking when copying data from the inflated buffer into the `AVBPrint` buffer. If the inflated data exceeds the allocated buffer size, a buffer overflow can occur, leading to potential memory corruption and security vulnerabilities."
