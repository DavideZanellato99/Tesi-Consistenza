"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow or wraparound.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the `state = (state << 8) | buf[i];` line within the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function. `state` is a `uint64_t`, but the shift and OR operation can lead to unexpected behavior if `state` is close to the maximum value. Specifically, if `state` is large enough, shifting it left by 8 bits and then ORing it with `buf[i]` can cause `state` to wrap around to a smaller value, potentially leading to incorrect header detection or frame size calculations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow or wraparound.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function. Specifically, the line `state = (state << 8) | buf[i];` shifts the `state` variable (a `uint64_t`) by 8 bits and then ORs it with the current byte from the buffer. If `state` is close to the maximum value of `uint64_t`, shifting it by 8 bits can cause an overflow, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect frame parsing. This can be exploited to cause denial of service or other vulnerabilities."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing an overflow. The result is often truncated or wrapped around, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function. Specifically, the line `state = (state << 8) | buf[i];` shifts the existing 64-bit `state` variable by 8 bits to the left and then ORs it with the current byte `buf[i]`. If `state` is close to the maximum 64-bit value, shifting it left by 8 bits can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller value. This can lead to incorrect header detection and frame parsing."
