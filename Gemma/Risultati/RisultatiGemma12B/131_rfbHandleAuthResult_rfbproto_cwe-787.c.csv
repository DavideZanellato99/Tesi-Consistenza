"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations using integer types can overflow or wrap around, leading to unexpected results.","The code allocates memory for `reason` using `malloc((uint64_t)reasonLen+1)`. If `reasonLen` is very large, the cast to `uint64_t` might cause an integer overflow, leading to a smaller allocation than intended. This can result in a buffer overflow when copying data into `reason` in the subsequent `ReadFromRFBServer` call."
