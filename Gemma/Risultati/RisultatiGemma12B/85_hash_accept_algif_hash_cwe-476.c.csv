"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated bounds of a buffer.","The code uses a fixed-size buffer `state` to store the hash context state. The size of this buffer is determined by `crypto_ahash_statesize(crypto_ahash_reqtfm(req))`. If the underlying cryptographic algorithm requires a state size larger than the allocated `state` buffer, a buffer overflow will occur during the `crypto_ahash_export` and `crypto_ahash_import` calls. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses a fixed-size buffer `state` to store the hash context state, and the size of this buffer is determined by `crypto_ahash_statesize(crypto_ahash_reqtfm(req))`. This function call can return a value larger than the `state` buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow. The `crypto_ahash_reqtfm` function could be manipulated to return a transformation that requires a larger state size than allocated."

"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated bounds of a buffer.

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows or wraps around, resulting in an unexpected value. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, and unexpected program behavior.","The code uses a fixed-size buffer `state` to store the hash context state. The size of this buffer is determined by `crypto_ahash_statesize(crypto_ahash_reqtfm(req))`. If the `crypto_ahash_reqtfm` returns a value that results in a very large `crypto_ahash_statesize`, the `state` buffer could overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow."
