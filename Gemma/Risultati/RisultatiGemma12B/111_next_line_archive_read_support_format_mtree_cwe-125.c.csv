"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing it to wrap around to a minimum value.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of `nbytes_req`. Specifically, `*ravail + 1023` can overflow if `*ravail` is close to the maximum value of `ssize_t`. The subsequent bitwise AND operation `& ~1023U` does not prevent the overflow from affecting the final value of `nbytes_req`, which is then used as the size argument to `__archive_read_ahead`. This can lead to a small value being passed to `__archive_read_ahead`, potentially causing it to read less data than expected, or a very large value being passed, potentially leading to a denial of service or memory exhaustion."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During calculations, an integer variable overflows, leading to an incorrect result.

Specifically, `*ravail+1023` can overflow if `*ravail` is close to the maximum value of ssize_t. The subsequent bitwise AND operation `& ~1023U` does not mitigate the overflow, and the resulting value can be significantly smaller than intended, leading to insufficient memory allocation in `__archive_read_ahead`.
