"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or offset that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads `partNumber` from the input stream using `OPENEXR_IMF_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE::Xdr::read`. The code then uses `partNumber` as an index into the `parts` vector: `Header& header = parts[partNumber]->header;`. There is no bounds checking on `partNumber` before using it as an index. If `partNumber` is negative or greater than or equal to `parts.size()`, this will result in an out-of-bounds access, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-Bounds Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads `partNumber` from the input stream using `OPENEXR_IMF_INTERNAL_NAMESPACE::Xdr::read`. The code then uses `partNumber` as an index into the `parts` vector: `Header& header = parts[partNumber]->header;`. There is no bounds checking on `partNumber` before using it as an index. If a malicious input provides a `partNumber` that is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `parts.size()`), this will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure. The code does check `partNumber<0 || partNumber> static_cast<int>(parts.size())` but this check is performed *after* the read operation, so the read can still occur out of bounds."
