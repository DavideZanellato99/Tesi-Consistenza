"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from one location to another without verifying the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the destination buffer.","The code copies `ifp->if_u1.if_data` into `tmpbuffer` using `memcpy`. The size of this copy is determined by `be16_to_cpu(sf->hdr.totsize)`. However, `sf` is later reinterpreted as `xfs_attr_shortform_t *sf = (xfs_attr_shortform_t *)tmpbuffer;`. This means that `sf->hdr.totsize` is accessed from the memory pointed to by `tmpbuffer`. If `totsize` is larger than the actual size of the data in `ifp->if_u1.if_data`, then `memcpy` will read beyond the bounds of `ifp->if_u1.if_data`, leading to a heap buffer overflow."
