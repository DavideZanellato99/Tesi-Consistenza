"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `PT_STRING8` case. The code checks if the length of the string data matches the allocated size (`mapidata->size`). However, it doesn't account for the null terminator. If `mapidata->size` doesn't include space for the null terminator, the `strlen` function will read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `PT_STRING8` case. The code checks if the length of the string data matches the allocated size (`mapidata->size`). However, it doesn't account for the null terminator. If `mapidata->size` is equal to `strlen((char*)mapidata->data)`, then the code will print ""Detected Hidden data"" even when there is no hidden data. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be exploited."
