"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `result`, but the loop copies `old[i].ext_size` into `result[i].ext_size` without validating it. If `old[i].ext_size` is larger than the allocated space for `result[i].ext`, `lys_ext_dup` will write beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a heap buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or offset that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code uses `calloc` to allocate memory for `result`, but the loop copies `old[i].ext_size` into `result[i].ext_size`. If `lys_ext_dup` allocates more memory than `old[i].ext_size` indicates, a buffer overflow can occur when `result[i].ext` is accessed later. This is because `result[i].ext_size` will not reflect the actual size of the allocated memory."
