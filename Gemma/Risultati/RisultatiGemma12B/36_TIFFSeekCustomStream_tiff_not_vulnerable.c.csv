"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow. The value wraps around to the minimum value, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the SEEK_CUR case. Specifically, the check `((offset > 0) && (profile->offset > (SSIZE_MAX-offset)))` and `((offset < 0) && (profile->offset < (-SSIZE_MAX-offset)))` are intended to prevent overflow, but they are flawed. If `profile->offset` is close to `SSIZE_MAX` and `offset` is positive, the overflow can still occur before the check is performed. Similarly, if `profile->offset` is close to `-SSIZE_MAX` and `offset` is negative, the overflow can still occur."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value or becomes negative when it should be positive, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the SEEK_CUR case. Specifically, the check `((offset > 0) && (profile->offset > (SSIZE_MAX-offset)))` and `((offset < 0) && (profile->offset < (-SSIZE_MAX-offset)))` are intended to prevent overflow, but they are flawed. If `profile->offset` is close to `SSIZE_MAX` and `offset` is positive, the first condition might not catch the overflow. Similarly, if `profile->offset` is close to `-SSIZE_MAX` and `offset` is negative, the second condition might not catch the overflow. This can lead to `profile->offset` exceeding the maximum or minimum representable value, resulting in undefined behavior."
