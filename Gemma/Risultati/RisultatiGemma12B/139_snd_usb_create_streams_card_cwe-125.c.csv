"1","True","CWE-667","Improper Error Handling","Improper error handling can lead to incorrect program behavior, including unexpected termination, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities.","The code attempts to access `host_iface->extralen` without checking if `host_iface->extra` is NULL. If `host_iface->extra` is NULL, accessing `host_iface->extra` will lead to a null pointer dereference."
"2","True","CWE-667","Improper Error Handling","The code does not properly handle the case where `usb_ifnum_to_if(dev, ctrlif + 1)` returns NULL, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.","The code attempts to access `usb_ifnum_to_if(dev, ctrlif + 1)->intf_assoc` without checking if `usb_ifnum_to_if(dev, ctrlif + 1)` is NULL. If `usb_ifnum_to_if(dev, ctrlif + 1)` returns NULL, dereferencing it will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior."
