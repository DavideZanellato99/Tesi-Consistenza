"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow or wraparound.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `if((MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image))` check. `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` and `filepos` are `size_t` types, which are unsigned. Adding two unsigned integers can result in an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value of `size_t`. This overflow can lead to a false negative, where the condition evaluates to false even though the actual sum is greater than `GetBlobSize(image)`, potentially leading to a buffer overflow later in the code when reading data into the image."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type.

The result is truncated or wrapped around, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `(MagickSizeType) (MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize+filepos) > GetBlobSize(image)`. If `MATLAB_HDR.ObjectSize` is a large value and `filepos` is also large, their sum could exceed the maximum value of `size_t`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow could result in a false comparison, allowing the code to proceed with potentially out-of-bounds memory access later in the function, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
