"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During the processing of data, an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be stored in the data type used to store the result. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, security vulnerabilities, and program crashes.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the `state = (state << 8) | buf[i];` line within the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function. The `state` variable is a `uint64_t`, but the shift and bitwise OR operation can lead to unexpected behavior if `state` is close to the maximum value. Specifically, if `state` is large enough, shifting it left by 8 bits and then ORing it with `buf[i]` can cause the most significant bits of `state` to be lost, potentially leading to incorrect header detection or frame size calculations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During calculations, an integer variable's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow. The result is then truncated or wrapped around, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has an integer overflow vulnerability in the `state = (state << 8) | buf[i];` line within the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function. `state` is a `uint64_t`, but the shift and bitwise OR operation can lead to unexpected behavior if `state` is close to the maximum value. Specifically, if `state` is large enough, shifting it left by 8 bits and then ORing it with `buf[i]` can cause `state` to wrap around, leading to incorrect header detection and potentially allowing the parser to process invalid data as a valid frame."
