"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);` line copies `label_len` bytes from the packet to the `name_out` buffer. The code checks `if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;` before the memcpy, but this check is insufficient. If `label_len` is close to `name_out_len`, a subsequent null terminator `*cp = '\0';` can overflow the buffer."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from an input source to a buffer without verifying the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);` line copies `label_len` bytes from the packet to the `name_out` buffer. The code checks `if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;` before the memcpy, but this check is insufficient. If `label_len` is close to `name_out_len`, a small amount of overflow can still occur before the check, especially if there are preceding dots. Additionally, the code doesn't account for the null terminator."
