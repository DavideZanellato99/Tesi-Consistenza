"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `cJSON_malloc` call allocates memory based on the length of the string *excluding* the null terminator. The subsequent copy loop does not account for the null terminator, potentially writing past the allocated buffer if the input string is very long or contains many escaped characters. The UTF-16 surrogate pair handling also contributes to this vulnerability, as it can increase the number of bytes written to the buffer."
