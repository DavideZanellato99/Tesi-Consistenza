"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `CopyMagickString` to copy the filename into the `path` buffer, but it doesn't check if the filename is too long. If the filename is longer than `MaxTextExtent - 1`, a buffer overflow will occur. The subsequent string manipulations (ConcatenateMagickString, FormatLocaleString) also don't perform bounds checking, exacerbating the risk."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `CopyMagickString` to copy the filename into the `path` buffer, but it doesn't perform any bounds checking. The subsequent operations, such as concatenating directory separators and filenames, can easily overflow the `MaxTextExtent` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `ConcatenateMagickString` function is also susceptible to buffer overflows if the combined length of the existing string in `path` and the string being concatenated exceeds `MaxTextExtent`."
"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from an input source to a destination buffer without verifying the size of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the destination buffer.","The code uses `CopyMagickString` to copy the filename into the `path` buffer, but it doesn't check if the filename is too long. If the filename is longer than `MaxTextExtent - 1`, a buffer overflow will occur. The subsequent string manipulations (ConcatenateMagickString, FormatLocaleString) also don't perform bounds checking, exacerbating the risk."
