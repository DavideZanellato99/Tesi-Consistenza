"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A program attempts to free the same memory location more than once. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.","The code uses `strdup` to duplicate strings and then potentially frees them later. However, in several `if` blocks, `free(r_symbol_name)` is called without checking if `r_symbol_name` is NULL. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability if `r_symbol_name` is NULL due to a previous condition."
"2","True","CWE-401","Resource Leak","A resource leak occurs when an application fails to release resources that it has acquired. This can include memory, file handles, sockets, and other system resources. Repeated resource leaks can eventually exhaust available resources, leading to application failure or denial of service.","The code uses `strdup` to duplicate strings and then potentially frees them later. However, in several `if` blocks, `r_symbol_name` is freed without being used, leading to a potential memory leak. Specifically, within the `if (name && strcmp (r_symbol_name, name))` block, `free (r_symbol_name)` is called, but the value of `r_symbol_name` is never used. Similarly, in the `if (at && (!symbol->size || !is_in_range (at, addr, symbol->size)))` block, `free (r_symbol_name)` is called without using the value. This pattern repeats in other conditional blocks as well."
