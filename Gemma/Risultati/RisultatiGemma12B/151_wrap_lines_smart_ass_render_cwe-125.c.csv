"1","True","CWE-399","Resource Management Error","A lack of proper resource management can lead to memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or other problems. This often occurs when resources are allocated but not freed, or when resources are freed without proper cleanup.","The code uses `realloc` to resize the `text_info->lines` array. However, it does not check if `realloc` returns NULL. If `realloc` fails, it returns NULL, and the code proceeds to dereference this NULL pointer in the subsequent `if (lead < text_info->length)` block, leading to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior."
