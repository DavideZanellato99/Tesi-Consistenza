"1","True","CWE-689","Incorrect Sign Handling","The code incorrectly handles the sign of an integer, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.","The function `SWFInput_readSBits` attempts to interpret a sequence of bits as a signed integer. The logic to handle the sign extension is flawed. If the most significant bit (MSB) is set, it subtracts 2^number from the result, which is incorrect for sign extension. This can lead to incorrect interpretation of the signed value, potentially causing unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the result is used in further calculations or comparisons."
"2","True","CWE-198","Signed Integer Representation","The code uses an incorrect method for sign extension when converting an unsigned integer to a signed integer, leading to incorrect results.","The function `SWFInput_readSBits` attempts to interpret a sequence of bits as a signed integer. The logic to handle the sign extension is flawed. If the most significant bit (MSB) is set, it subtracts `(1 << number)` from the result. This is incorrect for sign extension, which should duplicate the MSB to fill the higher-order bits. This can lead to incorrect interpretation of the signed value, potentially causing unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the result is used in further calculations."
"3","True","CWE-689","Incorrect Sign Handling","The code does not correctly handle the sign of the input, leading to incorrect results when negative values are expected.","The function `SWFInput_readSBits` attempts to interpret a sequence of bits as a signed integer. The logic to handle the sign extension is flawed. If the most significant bit (MSB) is set, it subtracts 2^number from the result instead of performing proper sign extension. This can lead to incorrect interpretation of negative values, potentially causing issues in subsequent processing of the data."
