"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `addrbuf` which is a fixed-size buffer (64 bytes) to store addresses derived from the input `data`. The `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern` functions, `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern1`, `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern2`, and `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern3`, populate this buffer. If the address calculation results in a string longer than 63 characters, a buffer overflow will occur. The `r_strbuf_set` and `r_strbuf_setf` functions then use this potentially overflowing buffer to construct the ESIL string, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior."
