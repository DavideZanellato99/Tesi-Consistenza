"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, causing an overflow. The result is often truncated or wrapped around, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `av_fast_malloc`'s size. Specifically, `FFALIGN(blockstodecode, 8)` is used to align the `blockstodecode` variable to 8 bytes. If `blockstodecode` is close to the maximum value of an integer, the alignment calculation could result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation size. This can cause a buffer overflow when writing to the allocated memory."

Specifically, `FFALIGN(blockstodecode, 8)` is used to align the size, and if `blockstodecode` is large enough, multiplying it by 8 could result in an integer overflow.
