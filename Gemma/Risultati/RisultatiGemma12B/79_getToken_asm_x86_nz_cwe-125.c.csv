"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code does not check for buffer overflows when incrementing `*end` within the `while` loops. If the input string `str` ends with an alphanumeric character, the loop will continue to increment `*end` beyond the end of the string, leading to a read-out-of-bounds access."
