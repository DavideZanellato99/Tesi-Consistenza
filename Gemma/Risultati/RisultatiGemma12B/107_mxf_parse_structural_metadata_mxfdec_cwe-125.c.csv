"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `av_dict_set` to set metadata values without checking the length of the value being set. Specifically, `material_package->name` is used directly as the value for ""material_package_name"" without any bounds checking. If `material_package->name` is excessively long, it can lead to a buffer overflow in the metadata dictionary."
