"1","True","CWE-770","Improper Error Handling","The code fails to handle errors properly, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. Specifically, the lack of error checking after the call to `xasprintf` can result in the use of a NULL pointer.","The code uses `xasprintf` to create `problem_id`. This function allocates memory and formats a string, but it doesn't check for allocation failures. If `xasprintf` fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, and the code proceeds to use this NULL pointer in subsequent operations (e.g., `log_info`, `dd_rename`), leading to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior."

"5","True","CWE-401","Resource Leak","A resource leak occurs when an application fails to release a resource that it has acquired.
