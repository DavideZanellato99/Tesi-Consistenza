"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A program attempts to free the same memory location multiple times. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.","The code has a resource leak. If kmalloc fails within the loop allocating individual commands, the code frees previously allocated commands and the command list, but it doesn't set instance->cmd_list to NULL before returning. This can lead to a double free if the calling function later attempts to free instance->cmd_list, assuming it's already NULL."
