"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, a data type's maximum value is exceeded, resulting in an overflow. The result ""wraps around"" to the minimum value of the data type, leading to unexpected behavior.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the check `(int)(g->sect * g->head) <= 0`. If `g->sect` and `g->head` are large enough, their product can exceed the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative value, which would incorrectly pass the check, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, a data type's maximum value is exceeded, resulting in an overflow. The result wraps around to the minimum value, or the overflow propagates to a different variable.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the check `(int)(g->sect * g->head) <= 0`. If `g->sect` and `g->head` are large enough, their product can exceed the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can result in a negative value, which would incorrectly pass the check, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an unexpected and potentially exploitable value.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the check `(int)(g->sect * g->head) <= 0`. If `g->sect` and `g->head` are large enough, their product can exceed the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an integer overflow.

If `g->sect` and `g->head` are large enough, their product can overflow, resulting in a negative value. This negative value will then satisfy the condition `(int)(g->sect * g->head) <= 0`, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the sanity checks and proceed with potentially harmful operations."
