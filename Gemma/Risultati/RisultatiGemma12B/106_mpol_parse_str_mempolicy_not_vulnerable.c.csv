"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","A null pointer is dereferenced, leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior.","The code uses `strchr` to find the positions of ':' and '=' in the input string `str`. It then uses these pointers to terminate the strings before the delimiters. However, if either ':' or '=' is not found in the string, `nodelist` or `flags` will be NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer in the subsequent code (e.g., `*nodelist++ = '\0';` or `*flags++ = '\0';`) will lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-149","NULL Dereference","The code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.","The code uses `strchr` to find the positions of ':' and '=' in the input string `str`. It then terminates the strings before these characters by inserting a null terminator. However, if either ':' or '=' is not found, `strchr` returns NULL. The code does not check for this NULL return value before attempting to dereference it (e.g., `*nodelist++ = '\0';` or `*flags++ = '\0';`). This leads to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior when either character is missing."
