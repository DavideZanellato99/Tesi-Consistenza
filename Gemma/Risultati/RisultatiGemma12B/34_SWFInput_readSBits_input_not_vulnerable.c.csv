"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet reads a certain number of bits from an input and adjusts the value based on a specific bit being set. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or integer overflows. The bitwise operations are safe given the input constraints."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet reads a certain number of bits from an input and adjusts the value based on a bitwise check. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or integer overflows. The bitwise operations are safe given the input constraints."
"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet checks if the most significant bit (MSB) of the read number is set. If it is, it subtracts 2^number from the number. This is a valid operation for handling signed bit representations in SWF files and doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities."
"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet reads a certain number of bits from an input and adjusts the value based on a specific bit being set. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or integer overflows. The bitwise operations are safe given the input constraints."
