"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A lack of sufficient bounds checking when reading from a buffer can allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory locations.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop condition `(passIC + 1)` is used as an index into `passInstructions`. If `passIC + 1` is out of bounds for `passInstructions`, accessing `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` will lead to a read-out-of-bounds error. Additionally, `k` is incremented in the loop, and `passInstructions[k]` is accessed. If the loop continues beyond the bounds of `passInstructions`, this will also result in a read-out-of-bounds error. The `kk` variable is also incremented within the loop and used to access `input->chars[kk]`. If `passIC + 2 + passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is larger than the size of `passInstructions`, then `passInstructions[k]` will cause a buffer overflow."

"3","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-Read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop condition `(passIC + 1)` is used as an index into `passInstructions`, but `passIC` is not validated. If `passIC` is close to the size of `passInstructions`, accessing `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` can lead to an out-of-bounds read. Additionally, the increment `kk++` inside the `if` statement can lead to `kk` exceeding `input->length` if the condition `passInstructions[k] != input->chars[kk++]` is met, resulting in an out-of-bounds read from `input->chars`."

Additionally, the increment `k++` inside the loop condition and `kk++` in the comparison can lead to `k` and `kk` exceeding the bounds of their respective arrays if the loop continues for too long."
