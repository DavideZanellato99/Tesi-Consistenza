"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer values can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, leading to unexpected behavior. This can be exploited to cause denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.","The code uses `fwrite(""SFW94A"",1,6,file)` to write a fixed-size string to a file. Subsequently, it reads `filesize` bytes from the input blob and writes them to the same file. The `filesize` is calculated using `filesize=65535UL*magick[2]+256L*magick[1]+magick[0]`. The `magick` array is populated with bytes read from the input blob. There's no validation on the values of `magick[0]`, `magick[1]`, and `magick[2]` before they are used to calculate `filesize`. If an attacker can control the input blob to set these values to large numbers, `filesize` can become very large, leading to a potential buffer overflow when writing to the temporary file."
