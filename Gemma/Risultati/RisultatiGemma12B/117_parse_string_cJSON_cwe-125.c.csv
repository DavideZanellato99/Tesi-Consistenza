"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Integer overflows and wraps can lead to a loss of data integrity. In this case, the incorrect handling of surrogate pairs can lead to incorrect UTF-8 encoding and potential buffer overflows.","The code attempts to handle UTF-16 surrogate pairs, but the validation logic is flawed. Specifically, it checks if `uc2` is within the range `0xDC00` to `0xDFFF`, but it doesn't verify that `uc` is within the range `0xD800` to `0xDBFF`. This can lead to incorrect UTF-8 encoding of invalid surrogate pairs, potentially resulting in buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Integer overflows and wraps can lead to a loss of data integrity. In this case, the incorrect handling of surrogate pairs can lead to the creation of invalid UTF-8 sequences, potentially causing issues when the string is used later.","The code attempts to handle UTF-16 surrogate pairs, but the validation logic is flawed. Specifically, it checks if `uc` is within the ranges 0xDC00-0xDFFF or 0, and if `uc` is within 0xD800-0xDBFF. However, it doesn't properly validate the second half of the surrogate pair (`uc2`). If a malformed surrogate pair is provided (e.g., a valid high surrogate but an invalid low surrogate), the code will proceed to construct an invalid UTF-8 sequence, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior."
