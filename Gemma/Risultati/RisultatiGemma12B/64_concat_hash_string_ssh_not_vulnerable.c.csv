"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `strncpy` to copy data from the packet payload into a buffer `buf`. The `buf_out_len` variable is used to track the length of the copied data, but it is not passed as an argument to `strncpy`. This means that `strncpy` might not null-terminate the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the copied string is long enough. The code also increments `buf_out_len` after each `strncpy` call, which could lead to writing beyond the bounds of the buffer if the initial `buf_out_len` is not properly initialized or if the length calculations are incorrect."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer is copied from one location to another without verifying the size of the input data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the destination buffer.","The code uses `strncpy` to copy data from the packet payload into a buffer `buf`. The `buf_out_len` variable is used to track the length of the copied data, but it is not passed as an argument to `strncpy`. This means that `strncpy` might not null-terminate the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the copied data is larger than the available space in `buf`. The code also does not specify the size of `buf`, making it impossible to determine the maximum safe length for the copied data."
