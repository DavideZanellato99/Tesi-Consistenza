"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `addrbuf` which is a fixed-size buffer (64 bytes) to store addresses derived from the input `data`. The `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_pattern*` functions populate this buffer, and the code doesn't perform any bounds checking before copying data into it. If the patterns returned by these functions are longer than 63 bytes, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially overwriting adjacent memory."
