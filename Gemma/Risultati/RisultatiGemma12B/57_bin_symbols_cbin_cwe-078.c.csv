"1","True","CWE-401","Resource Leak","A resource leak occurs when an application fails to release resources that it has acquired. This can include memory, file handles, sockets, and other system resources. Repeated resource leaks can eventually exhaust available resources, leading to application failure or system instability.","The code uses `strdup` to duplicate strings and then potentially frees them later. However, in several `if` blocks, `r_symbol_name` is freed without being used, leading to a potential memory leak. Specifically, within the `if (name && strcmp (r_symbol_name, name))` block, `free (r_symbol_name)` is called, but the value of `r_symbol_name` is never used. Similarly, in the `if (at && (!symbol->size || !is_in_range (at, addr, symbol->size)))` block, `free (r_symbol_name)` is called without using the value. These premature frees result in memory leaks."
