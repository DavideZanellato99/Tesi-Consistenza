"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","A pathname is used to access a file or directory, but the pathname does not adequately restrict access to the intended directory.","The code is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. The `SystemUtilities::isDirectory(path)` check doesn't prevent an attacker from providing a path like ""../../../etc/passwd"" to `extract`. If the path is a directory, the code appends `getFilename()` to it, potentially leading to extraction of files outside the intended directory."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","A pathname traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to access files or directories outside the intended boundary.
