"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","A buffer copy function without checking the size of the input data copies more data than the destination buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` call within the `if (memcpyed && context->prefilter != NULL)` block. The size of the data being copied (`bsize`) is not validated against the size of the destination buffer (`_tmp2` and `_tmp3`). If `bsize` is larger than the allocated size of `_tmp2` and `_tmp3`, a buffer overflow can occur, leading to potential code execution or data corruption."
