"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Overflow","A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a buffer.","The code uses snprintf to construct a key for the return array. The size of stats_key is fixed at 30, but the hostname and port combined could potentially exceed this size, leading to a buffer overflow."
