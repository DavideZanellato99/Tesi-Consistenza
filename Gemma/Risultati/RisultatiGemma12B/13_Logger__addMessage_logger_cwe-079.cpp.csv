"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears safe. It uses a QWriteLocker to protect access to the m_messages queue, preventing race conditions. The queue has a fixed size (MAX_LOG_MESSAGES), and old messages are removed when the queue is full, preventing unbounded memory growth. The use of QDateTime::currentMSecsSinceEpoch() is standard for timestamping. The emit statement suggests the message is being sent to a consumer, which is not analyzed here."
