"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations performed on integer data types result in a value that is too large to be represented, leading to an overflow or wraparound.","The code performs a check `(DstWidth > UINT32_MAX / DstHeight)`. However, the subsequent calculation `size *= GetBytesPerPixel(bitmap->format)` uses `size` which is `DstWidth * DstHeight`. If `DstWidth * DstHeight` exceeds `UINT32_MAX`, this multiplication will wrap around, leading to an incorrect `size` value. This incorrect `size` is then used in `_aligned_malloc(bitmap->length, 16)`, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow if the actual required size is larger than the allocated size."
