"1","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code has a potential denial-of-service vulnerability due to a missing check before accessing `floppy_sizes[cnt]` within the `type` branch. The loop `for (cnt = type << 2; cnt < (type << 2) + 4; cnt++)` calculates the index `cnt` based on the `type` parameter. If `type` is sufficiently large, `type << 2` can result in a value that, when added to 4, exceeds the bounds of the `floppy_sizes` array, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This can crash the system or lead to unpredictable behavior."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","During arithmetic or logical operations, an integer's value exceeds the maximum representable value for its data type, resulting in an overflow or wraparound.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the line `(unsigned char)((g->sect << 2) >> FD_SIZECODE(g)) == 0`. If `g->sect` is a large value, `g->sect << 2` can result in an integer overflow. The result of the overflow is then right-shifted by `FD_SIZECODE(g)`, which can lead to an unexpected value being compared to zero. This can bypass the intended check and allow invalid geometry parameters to be accepted."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer variable overflows, leading to an unexpected value. This can result in incorrect program behavior, including security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation `(g->sect << 2) >> FD_SIZECODE(g)`. If `g->sect` is large enough, the left shift operation `g->sect << 2` can result in an integer overflow. The subsequent right shift operation `>> FD_SIZECODE(g)` might not effectively mitigate the overflow, leading to an incorrect value being compared to 0. This can bypass the intended sanity check and potentially lead to further vulnerabilities."
"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Some calculations compute large values that exceed the capacity of the data type. If the result overflows, the value wraps around to a small, unexpected value. This can lead to incorrect program behavior, including security vulnerabilities.","The code has a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation `(g->sect << 2) >> FD_SIZECODE(g)`. If `g->sect` is a large value, left-shifting it by 2 can result in an integer overflow. The subsequent right shift might then produce an unexpected result, potentially leading to incorrect geometry calculations and subsequent errors."
"5","True","CWE-125","Buffer Over-read","A program attempts to read data from a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer.","The code has a potential denial-of-service vulnerability due to a missing check before accessing `floppy_sizes[cnt]` within the `type` branch. Specifically, the loop `for (cnt = type << 2; cnt < (type << 2) + 4; cnt++)` calculates indices into `floppy_sizes` based on the `type` parameter. If `type` is sufficiently large, `type << 2` can result in an out-of-bounds access to `floppy_sizes`, leading to a crash or memory corruption. The size of `floppy_sizes` is not explicitly defined, but it's likely a fixed-size array."
