"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A program attempts to free the same memory location multiple times. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.","The code has a resource leak. If kmalloc fails within the loop allocating individual commands, the code frees previously allocated commands and the command list, but it doesn't reset instance->cmd_list to NULL before returning. This can lead to a double free if the function is called again later, as instance->cmd_list will still point to freed memory."

"3","True","CWE-398","Resource Leak","A resource leak occurs when an application fails to release a resource that is no longer needed, leading to a depletion of available resources.","The code has a resource leak. If kmalloc fails within the loop allocating individual commands, the code frees previously allocated commands but does not free the initial array allocated by kcalloc. This leads to a memory leak as the initial array remains allocated."
"4","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A program attempts to free the same memory location more than once.","The code has a resource leak. If kmalloc fails within the loop allocating individual commands, the code frees previously allocated commands and the command list, but it doesn't reset instance->cmd_list to NULL before returning. This can lead to a double free if the function is called again later, as instance->cmd_list will still point to freed memory."
