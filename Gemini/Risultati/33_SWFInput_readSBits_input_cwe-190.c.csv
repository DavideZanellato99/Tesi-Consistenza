"1","True","CWE-758","Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior","The product relies on undefined, unspecified, or implementation-defined behavior, which can lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities when the code is compiled with a different compiler, different compiler options, or executed on a different platform.","The code is vulnerable to undefined behavior because the 'number' parameter is not validated. If 'number' is 0, the expression '1<<(number-1)' results in '1<<-1', which is undefined behavior according to the C standard. If 'number' is greater than or equal to the bit width of an 'int' (e.g., 32 for a 32-bit int), the expressions '1<<(number-1)' or '1<<number' will result in undefined behavior due to an excessive shift amount or shifting into the sign bit of a signed integer. This can lead to incorrect calculations, crashes, or other unpredictable behavior."

The `number` parameter is used in `(1<<(number-1))` and `(1<<number)` without validation.
