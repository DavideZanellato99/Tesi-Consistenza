"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously ascertained to be NULL, or that could be NULL if an earlier memory allocation failed, or that becomes NULL because of an explicit assignment. This typically causes a program crash or exit, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service.","The code accesses handle->h_transaction->t_journal->j_private without explicitly checking if handle->h_transaction->t_journal is a NULL pointer. Although handle->h_transaction is checked for NULL, if handle->h_transaction is valid but its t_journal member is NULL, dereferencing t_journal to access j_private would lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This could cause a kernel panic or system crash, resulting in a Denial of Service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not gracefully handle the resulting error. This typically causes the application to crash, which may lead to a denial of service.","The code dereferences handle->h_transaction->t_journal to access j_private without checking if t_journal is a NULL pointer. Although handle and handle->h_transaction are checked for validity, handle->h_transaction->t_journal is not. If handle->h_transaction->t_journal is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, potentially leading to a kernel panic or denial of service."
