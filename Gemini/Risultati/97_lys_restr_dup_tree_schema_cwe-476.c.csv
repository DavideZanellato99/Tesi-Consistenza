"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code iterates 'size' times, accessing 'old[i]' in each iteration. If the 'size' parameter, which dictates the loop's upper bound, is larger than the actual allocated or valid size of the 'old' array/buffer, an out-of-bounds read will occur. This can lead to crashes (denial of service) or information disclosure by reading data from adjacent memory locations. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the 'old' array based on the provided 'size'."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates up to 'size' elements from the 'old' array. If the 'size' parameter is larger than the actual allocated or valid size of the 'old' array, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing 'old[i]' within the loop. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior, as the function does not validate if 'size' is within the bounds of the 'old' array."
