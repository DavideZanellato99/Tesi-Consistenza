"1","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software receives input from an untrusted source and includes that input in the output page without neutralizing it. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or script code, which is then executed by the victim's browser.","The code sets user-controlled strings such as peer.flagsDescription() and torrent filenames (from downloadingFiles) directly into a Qt model for display, including for Qt::ToolTipRole, without proper HTML escaping. Since Qt tooltips can interpret rich text (HTML), a malicious peer could provide crafted input containing HTML tags. When displayed in the application's UI, this unescaped input would be rendered as HTML, leading to a UI-level injection vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or script-like content into the user interface, potentially causing UI defacement or information disclosure."

"4","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in an output that is used as a web page or desktop application UI, which is then served to other users.","The code displays user-controlled torrent filenames obtained from torrent->info().filesForPiece() by joining them into a string. This string is then set as data for a QStandardItemModel column and its tooltip. Unlike the peer.client() string, which is explicitly HTML-escaped using Utils::String::toHtmlEscaped(), the joined filenames are not. If the PeerListWidget or its associated delegate renders these strings in a rich text context, a malicious torrent creator could embed HTML or script tags in filenames, leading to UI defacement or other client-side injection attacks within the application. The explicit HTML escaping for peer.client() suggests awareness of this risk, making the omission for filenames a potential oversight."
