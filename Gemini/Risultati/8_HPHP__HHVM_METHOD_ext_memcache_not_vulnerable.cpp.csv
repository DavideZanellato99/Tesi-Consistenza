"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product accesses or dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which is NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code calls `memcached_server_instance_by_position` to retrieve a server instance. The return value, `instance`, is then used directly in `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME(instance)` without checking if `instance` is `NULL`. If `memcached_server_instance_by_position` fails (e.g., `server_id` is out of bounds, or other internal errors) and returns `NULL`, then `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME(instance)` (which likely expands to `instance->hostname` or similar) will attempt to dereference a null pointer. This will lead to a segmentation fault and application crash, resulting in a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has been shown to be NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code retrieves a hostname using `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME(instance)`. This macro wraps `memcached_server_name` from the `libmemcached` library. While `memcached_server_instance_by_position` is called within valid bounds, there is no explicit check that the `hostname` pointer returned by `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME` is not `nullptr` before it is passed to `strlen()`. If, under certain error conditions (e.g., a malformed server entry in the memcached configuration or an unexpected library state), `LMCD_SERVER_HOSTNAME` were to return `nullptr`, calling `strlen(hostname)` would attempt to dereference a null pointer. This would result in a program crash (segmentation fault), leading to a denial of service."
