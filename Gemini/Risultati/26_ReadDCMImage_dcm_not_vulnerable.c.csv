"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to a wraparound or truncation of the result. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The code calculates a memory allocation size using `(length+1)*quantum`. If `size_t` is 32-bit and `length` (derived from a 32-bit signed integer `datum`) and `quantum` (which can be 1, 2, 4, or 8) are sufficiently large, this multiplication can overflow `size_t`. This results in a much smaller memory allocation than intended. Subsequently, the `ReadBlob` function attempts to read `quantum*length` bytes into this undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious DICOM file to achieve arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure."

"4","True","CWE-134","Uncontrolled Format String","The product uses a user-provided format string in a formatted output routine, which can lead to an information leak or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The `explicit_vr` variable, which is populated with 2 bytes directly from the input DICOM file, is used as a format string argument in `FormatLocaleFile(stdout,""0x%04lX %4ld %s-%s (0x%04lx,0x%04lx)"", ..., explicit_vr, ...);`. An attacker can embed format specifiers (e.g., %x, %n) in the DICOM file's `explicit_vr` field, leading to information disclosure or arbitrary memory writes, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution."
