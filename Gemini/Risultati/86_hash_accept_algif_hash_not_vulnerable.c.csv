"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not assigned a value, which can lead to a crash or an arbitrary write vulnerability.","The code retrieves `ask` from `sk` and `ctx` from `ask->private` without checking if `ask` or `ask->private` are NULL. If `sk->sk_alg` is NULL, `ask` will be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing `ask->private`. Similarly, if `ask->private` is NULL, `ctx` will be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing `ctx->req`. These unchecked dereferences can cause a kernel panic, resulting in a Denial of Service."
"2","True","CWE-789","Uncontrolled Allocation of Memory Buffer","The product allocates a memory buffer, but it does not sufficiently control the size of the buffer, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service or other impact.","The code uses a Variable Length Array (VLA) `char state[crypto_ahash_statesize(...)]` on the kernel stack. The size of this VLA is determined by the return value of `crypto_ahash_statesize`, which depends on the cryptographic algorithm in use. If an attacker can influence the selection of a cryptographic algorithm that has an excessively large state size, or if such an algorithm is available for use in this context, it could lead to a kernel stack overflow. A stack overflow in the kernel can cause a denial of service (kernel panic) or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities, as kernel stack sizes are limited and not designed for arbitrary large allocations."
