"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit in the application. This typically occurs when the pointer is returned from a function that indicates an error by returning NULL, and the caller does not check for NULL before dereferencing the pointer.","The code calls av_log with a format string containing %s and the return value of avcodec_get_name(st->codecpar->codec_id). If st->codecpar->codec_id is AV_CODEC_ID_NONE (which can occur if the codec Universal Label is not recognized), avcodec_get_name returns NULL. Passing NULL to av_log (which behaves like printf) with a %s format specifier results in undefined behavior, typically a segmentation fault or crash, leading to a denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs a memcpy operation using descriptor->extradata_size as the size argument. If an attacker provides a crafted MXF file where descriptor->extradata_size is larger than the actual allocated buffer for descriptor->extradata, this will result in an out-of-bounds read from descriptor->extradata. This can lead to information disclosure, crashes, or other undefined behavior."
