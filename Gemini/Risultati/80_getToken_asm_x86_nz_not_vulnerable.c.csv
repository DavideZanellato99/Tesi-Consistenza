"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function getToken does not validate that the input parameter str is not a NULL pointer before attempting to dereference it. Specifically, the call to strlen(str) in the initial if condition will result in a NULL pointer dereference if str is NULL, leading to a program crash."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established as valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The pointers 'begin' and 'end' are dereferenced in multiple locations, such as 'if (*begin > strlen(str))' and '*end = *begin;', without prior checks to ensure they are not NULL. If either 'begin' or 'end' is a NULL pointer when passed to the function, dereferencing it will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
