"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code snippet contains a buffer over-read vulnerability. When parsing a non-pointer label, the function copies label_len bytes from the input packet buffer using memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len). Although j is advanced by GET8 to point to the start of the label data, there is no explicit check to ensure that j + label_len does not exceed the total length of the packet buffer. If a malicious or malformed packet provides a label_len value such that j + label_len > length, the memcpy operation will attempt to read data beyond the allocated bounds of the packet buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This could result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially lead to further exploitation."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer over-read. In the normal label parsing path, after reading the label_len byte using GET8(label_len), the internal pointer 'j' is incremented by one. The subsequent memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len) attempts to copy 'label_len' bytes from the packet. However, the bounds check 'if (j >= length)' performed before GET8 only ensures that the 'label_len' byte itself is within bounds, not that the subsequent 'label_len' bytes of data are also within the 'packet' buffer. If 'j' (before GET8) is 'length - 1' and 'label_len' is greater than zero, then 'j' will become 'length' after GET8, and the memcpy will attempt to read 'label_len' bytes starting from 'packet[length]', resulting in an out-of-bounds read."
