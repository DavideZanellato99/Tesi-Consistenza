"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service. This can occur when the product allocates an excessive amount of memory, CPU, or other resources in response to a crafted input, without proper limits or cleanup mechanisms.","The code contains a parsing logic error within the `comment_correction` mechanism. This mechanism attempts to handle malformed JPEG COM sections by effectively skipping up to two non-0xFF bytes and treating them as padding (`marker = 0xff; comment_correction--;`). This behavior can lead to a desynchronization of the parser's state with the actual file content. If a legitimate marker or data bytes are skipped due to this correction logic, subsequent bytes (which were intended as data) can be misinterpreted as segment length bytes (`lh` and `ll`). This results in an arbitrary `itemlen` value (up to 65535, derived from `(lh << 8) | ll`). This potentially incorrect `itemlen` is then used in `exif_file_sections_add` to allocate memory. A malicious actor could craft a JPEG file that triggers this desynchronization repeatedly, causing the application to allocate numerous buffers of up to 65536 bytes each. This can lead to excessive memory consumption and a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting available system memory."
