"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code. This can happen when a program frees memory, but then continues to use a pointer to the freed memory. If the freed memory is reallocated to another part of the program, the original pointer might now point to valid, but unintended, data. If the freed memory is not reallocated, the original pointer might point to invalid memory, leading to a crash.","The function returns a hostent structure where the h_addr_list member contains pointers to memory that is freed by the function before returning. Specifically, the addrs buffer, which holds the IP addresses, is freed immediately after its contents are referenced by pointers in hostent->h_addr_list. Any subsequent access to these addresses by the caller will result in a use-after-free vulnerability, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. After advancing 'aptr' by 'RRFIXEDSZ', 'aptr' points to the start of the Resource Record (RR) data. The preceding bounds check 'if (aptr + RRFIXEDSZ > abuf + alen)' ensures that 'aptr' (before adding 'RRFIXEDSZ') is at most 'abuf + alen - RRFIXEDSZ'. Consequently, 'aptr' (after adding 'RRFIXEDSZ') can point to 'abuf + alen - 1', 'abuf + alen - 2', or 'abuf + alen - 3'. When processing a T_A record, the 'memcpy' operation attempts to read 'sizeof(struct in_addr)' (typically 4) bytes from 'aptr'. If 'aptr' is within 1 to 3 bytes from 'abuf + alen', this 'memcpy' will read beyond the allocated buffer 'abuf', leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure or a denial of service (crash)."
