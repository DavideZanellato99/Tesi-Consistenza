"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer value that is outside the range of the intended data type, leading to a wraparound or truncation that can result in unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or other vulnerabilities.","The binary search algorithm calculates the middle index as mid = (first + last) / 2. If first and last are sufficiently large unsigned int values, their sum first + last can exceed the maximum value representable by an unsigned int, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow causes mid to be calculated incorrectly, which can result in an infinite loop (denial of service) or an out-of-bounds read when accessing insn_regs_intel_sorted[mid], potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a certain size. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The binary search implementation calculates the mid-point index as `mid = (first + last) / 2`. If the sum `first + last` exceeds the maximum value representable by an `unsigned int` (which is the type of `first`, `last`, and `mid`), an integer overflow will occur. This overflow results in an incorrect `mid` index, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `insn_regs_intel_sorted[mid]`, potentially causing information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
