"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory. This can allow an attacker to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.","The code constructs file paths by concatenating the destination path with the file name extracted from the archive without sanitizing or validating the file name for directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../). An attacker can craft a malicious ZIP archive containing file entries with names like ../../../../etc/passwd, leading to files being written outside the intended destination directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or writing to arbitrary locations on the filesystem."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or similar constructs that can resolve to a location outside of that directory. This allows an attacker to access or create files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem.","The code is vulnerable to path traversal. The file names extracted from the ZIP archive (qfile_name) are directly concatenated with the destination path (destpath) to form the full file_path. An attacker can craft a ZIP archive containing file names with path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../malicious_file) to write files outside the intended destination directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious executables in arbitrary locations if the process has sufficient privileges. Although QFileInfo is used, it does not prevent the final file_path from resolving outside the intended destination directory."
