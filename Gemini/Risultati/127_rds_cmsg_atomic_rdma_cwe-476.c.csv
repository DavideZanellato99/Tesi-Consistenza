"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The program writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code allows a user-controlled address (args->local_addr) to be passed to rds_pin_pages, which pins a single page for RDMA operations. If rds_pin_pages does not sufficiently validate that args->local_addr refers to a valid user-space memory region owned by the calling process, a malicious user could potentially provide a kernel address or an address belonging to another process. This could lead to an arbitrary 8-byte read or write operation in kernel memory or other process memory via the subsequent sg_set_page and RDMA operations, resulting in privilege escalation or information disclosure. The check for 8-byte alignment (args->local_addr & 0x7) is insufficient to prevent this type of memory access violation."
"2","True","CWE-617","Reachable Assertion","The product contains an assertion that is reachable by an attacker, which can lead to a denial of service or other attacks. Assertions are typically used to check for conditions that 'should never happen' in a correctly functioning program. When an assertion is triggered by malicious input, it can cause the program to terminate abruptly, leading to a denial of service, or in some cases, expose sensitive information or allow further exploitation.","The code processes a user-controlled 'cmsg_type' field from a control message within a switch statement. The 'default' case of this switch statement contains a BUG() call. If an attacker provides an invalid or unexpected 'cmsg_type' value, the BUG() call will be triggered, leading to a kernel panic and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for the system."
