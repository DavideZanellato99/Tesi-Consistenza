"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code uses the 'type' and 'drive' parameters as array indices without performing bounds checks against the actual sizes of the 'floppy_type', 'floppy_sizes', 'user_params', and 'current_type' arrays. An attacker could provide out-of-range values for 'type' or 'drive', leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. This could result in denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution if critical data structures or function pointers are overwritten."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code snippet uses the 'type' and 'drive' parameters as array indices without performing explicit bounds checks against the sizes of the 'floppy_type', 'floppy_sizes', 'user_params', and 'current_type' arrays. If an attacker can control the values of 'type' or 'drive' to be outside the valid range of these arrays, it could lead to an out-of-bounds write. This can result in data corruption, denial of service (program crash), or potentially arbitrary code execution. For instance, 'floppy_type[type] = *g;', 'floppy_sizes[cnt]' (where 'cnt' is derived from 'type'), 'user_params[drive] = *g;', 'current_type[drive] = &user_params[drive];', and 'floppy_sizes[drive] = user_params[drive].size;' are all susceptible to this vulnerability."
