"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code initializes the source pointer `ss` to `src->data - 1` when `x >= 0` due to the `early` flag being set to 1. This causes `ss` to point one byte before the allocated `src->data` buffer. Subsequent operations within the `jbig2_image_compose_opt_...` functions, which dereference `ss` (e.g., accessing `s[0]` as indicated by the comment `((s[0]<<8)|s[1])`), will result in an out-of-bounds read from memory immediately preceding the source image data buffer. This can lead to information disclosure or a crash."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the calculation is used to determine a memory allocation size or an offset into a buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other subsequent vulnerabilities.","The code is vulnerable to multiple integer overflows and an out-of-bounds read, as well as a NULL pointer dereference. Integer overflows can occur in calculations for `syoffset = -y * src->stride` and `y * dst->stride` if `y` is `INT_MIN` and `src->stride` or `dst->stride` are sufficiently large, causing the `uint32_t` result to wrap around. Similarly, the calculation `((uint32_t) x + w - 1)` for `bytewidth` can overflow if `x` and `w` are large. These overflows lead to incorrect memory offsets and buffer sizes, resulting in out-of-bounds reads or writes when accessing image data. Additionally, an out-of-bounds read occurs when `ss` is initialized as `src->data - early` where `early` is 1 (for `x >= 0`), causing `ss` to point one byte before `src->data`, which can be accessed by `s[0]` in subsequent operations. Furthermore, the `dst` pointer is not checked for NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference if `dst` is NULL."
