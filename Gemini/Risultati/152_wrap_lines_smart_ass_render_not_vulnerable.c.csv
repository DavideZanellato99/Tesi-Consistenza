"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the loop `for (i = 0; i <= text_info->length; ++i)`, the loop condition allows `i` to reach `text_info->length`. Assuming `text_info->length` represents the number of elements in the `text_info->glyphs` array (meaning valid indices are from `0` to `text_info->length - 1`), when `i` equals `text_info->length`, the expression `cur = text_info->glyphs + i` attempts to access `text_info->glyphs[text_info->length]`, which is one element past the allocated buffer. Subsequently, `cur->linebreak` dereferences this out-of-bounds pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in a crash, unpredictable program behavior, or potential information disclosure by reading data from adjacent memory locations."
