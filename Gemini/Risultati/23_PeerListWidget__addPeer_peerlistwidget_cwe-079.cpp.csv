"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are requested or influenced by an actor, which can be used to consume more resources than intended. This can lead to a denial of service or other detrimental impacts.","The code processes filenames from untrusted torrent metadata without imposing limits on their length or quantity. An attacker can craft torrents with an excessive number of files or extremely long filenames. When these filenames are joined and stored in the GUI model, it can lead to uncontrolled memory consumption, potentially causing a denial-of-service for the application."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not adequately control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code processes downloadingFiles obtained from external input (torrent metadata and peer information). If an attacker can manipulate this input to cause torrent->info().filesForPiece() to return an extremely large QStringList, the subsequent join operations will create a very large QString for display and tooltip roles. Storing and rendering such large strings in the QStandardItemModel can lead to excessive memory consumption and performance degradation, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application due to uncontrolled resource consumption."
