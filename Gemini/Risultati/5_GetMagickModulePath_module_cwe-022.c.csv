"1","True","CWE-427","Uncontrolled Search Path Element","The product uses a search path to find resources, but it does not sufficiently control the elements of the path, which can allow an attacker to modify the path to point to a malicious resource.","The code constructs module paths using environment variables such as MAGICK_CODER_MODULE_PATH, MAGICK_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, USERPROFILE, and HOME. It also implicitly searches the current working directory. An attacker can manipulate these environment variables or the current working directory to inject a malicious module, leading to arbitrary code execution when the application attempts to load a module."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software constructs a pathname using an externally-controlled input, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the intended directory. This can allow an attacker to read, write, or execute arbitrary files on the system.","The function constructs file paths by concatenating various base directories (from environment variables, hardcoded paths, registry, or executable location) with the filename parameter. The filename parameter is not sanitized to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., ../). An attacker could provide a filename like ../../etc/passwd to access files outside the intended module directories. If the subsequent module loading mechanism attempts to open or execute such a path, it could lead to arbitrary file access or code execution."
