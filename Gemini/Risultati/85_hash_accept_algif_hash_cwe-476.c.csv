"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The program copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without properly checking the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code allocates a Variable-Length Array (VLA) named 'state' on the stack. The size of this VLA is determined by the return value of 'crypto_ahash_statesize()'. If an attacker can influence the cryptographic algorithm or its parameters to cause 'crypto_ahash_statesize()' to return an excessively large value, it could lead to a stack overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource. This can lead to a denial of service or other undesirable impacts.","The code uses a Variable Length Array (VLA) named state whose size is determined by the return value of crypto_ahash_statesize(crypto_ahash_reqtfm(req)). If an attacker can manipulate the req object (which is derived from the input sock parameter) to cause crypto_ahash_statesize to return an excessively large value, it could lead to a stack overflow, exhausting the limited stack resource. This can result in a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel context."
