"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code accesses `data[1]` and `data[2]` for multi-byte instructions (e.g., JSR, JMP, and implicitly within `_6502_anal_esil_get_addr_patternX` functions) without first verifying that the provided `len` parameter is sufficient. If `len` is less than the expected instruction size (which can be determined by `snes_op_get_size` but not explicitly checked before subsequent `data` accesses), these accesses will result in an out-of-bounds read from the `data` buffer, potentially leading to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code accesses elements data[1] and data[2] without checking if the provided 'len' parameter is sufficient, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads. For example, opcodes like JSR (0x20), JMP (0x4c, 0x6c), and many others that use 2 or 3 bytes, directly access data[1] and data[2] without verifying that 'len' is at least 2 or 3 respectively. This can result in crashes or information disclosure."
