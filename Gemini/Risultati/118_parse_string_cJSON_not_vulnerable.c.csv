"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be larger than it is, or that it has not wrapped around. This can lead to a buffer overflow, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The 'len' variable, used to calculate the required buffer size for the parsed string, is an 'int'. If the input JSON string is excessively long, 'len' can overflow. An integer overflow in 'len' can lead to an incorrect (potentially small or negative) size being passed to cJSON_malloc. This can result in a heap buffer overflow when the string data is subsequently written into the undersized buffer, or a denial of service if the overflowed 'len' (when cast to an unsigned size_t) causes an attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The `len` variable, used to calculate the required buffer size for the parsed string, is an integer. If the input JSON string is extremely long (e.g., exceeding the maximum value an `int` can hold), `len` can overflow and wrap around to a small positive value. This leads to `cJSON_malloc` allocating an undersized buffer. Subsequently, the loop that processes the entire (long) input string and copies characters to the `out` buffer will write beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow."
