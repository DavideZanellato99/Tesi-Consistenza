"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The memcpy function copies `crgram_len` bytes from `crgram` into `sbuf+1`. The total size written to `sbuf` is `crgram_len + 1`. If `crgram_len + 1` exceeds `SC_MAX_APDU_BUFFER_SIZE`, which is the fixed size of `sbuf`, a buffer overflow will occur. This is particularly possible when `crgram_len` is large enough to trigger an extended APDU (i.e., `crgram_len > 255`), as `SC_MAX_APDU_BUFFER_SIZE` is often smaller than the maximum possible extended APDU data length (65535)."

"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Uncontrolled Copy')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the sbuf buffer. The memcpy operation copies crgram_len bytes into sbuf starting at sbuf[1], and sbuf[0] is set separately. The total data written to sbuf is crgram_len + 1. There is no check to ensure that crgram_len + 1 does not exceed the fixed size of sbuf (SC_MAX_APDU_BUFFER_SIZE). An attacker can provide a sufficiently large crgram_len value to cause an overflow, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."
