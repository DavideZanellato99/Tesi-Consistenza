"1","True","CWE-502","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The product deserializes untrusted data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other attacks. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to remote code execution, bypass security mechanisms, and other attacks. Attackers can manipulate serialized objects to inject malicious data or alter application logic during deserialization.","The code performs deserialization of WDDX data, including the creation of PHP objects and the invocation of their __wakeup() magic method. An attacker can craft malicious WDDX input to instantiate arbitrary classes and set their properties, leading to PHP Object Injection. This can result in arbitrary code execution, file system manipulation, or other severe impacts if a vulnerable class with exploitable magic methods (like __wakeup()) exists in the application's scope."
"2","True","CWE-502","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid or harmless. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other attacks.","The code deserializes WDDX data and, if an object is encountered, it calls the __wakeup() method on that object. This is a classic PHP Object Injection vulnerability (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). An attacker can craft malicious WDDX input to instantiate arbitrary classes and trigger their __wakeup() methods, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or other impacts depending on the available classes and their methods. Additionally, the ability to set arbitrary properties on objects during deserialization further enhances the exploitability of this vulnerability."
