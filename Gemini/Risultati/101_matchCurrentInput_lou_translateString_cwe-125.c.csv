"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds reads. The loop's upper bound is determined by `passInstructions[passIC + 1]`. If `passIC + 1` is an invalid index for `passInstructions`, an out-of-bounds read occurs, and the resulting arbitrary value will dictate the loop's length. This can lead to `input->chars[kk]` and `passInstructions[k]` accessing memory outside their allocated buffers as `kk` and `k` increment without proper bounds checks against the actual sizes of `input->chars` and `passInstructions`."

"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code performs multiple array accesses without proper bounds checking. Specifically, `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` is accessed to determine the loop's iteration count. If `passIC + 1` is an invalid index for `passInstructions`, it leads to an out-of-bounds read. Additionally, `input->chars[kk]` is accessed where `kk` is derived from the `pos` parameter and incremented within the loop, with the loop's length controlled by `passInstructions[passIC + 1]`. If `pos` is initially out of bounds or if the loop iterates too many times, `input->chars[kk]` will also result in an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could manipulate `pos` or `passIC` and the contents of `passInstructions` to trigger these out-of-bounds reads, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
