"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow (read) due to insufficient validation of the 'descriptor->extradata_size' value. If a malicious MXF file provides an 'extradata_size' value that is larger than the actual data available at 'descriptor->extradata', the 'memcpy' call will attempt to read beyond the bounds of the 'descriptor->extradata' buffer. This can lead to a crash (denial of service) or potentially information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit of the product, denying service to legitimate users.","The code repeatedly calls mxf_get_codec_ul to resolve Universal Labels (ULs) for codecs, containers, and pixel formats. The mxf_get_codec_ul function is designed to return NULL if a given UL is not found in its internal lookup tables. However, in multiple instances, the return value of mxf_get_codec_ul is immediately dereferenced (e.g., codec_ul->id, container_ul->id, pix_fmt_ul->id, container_ul->desc) without checking if the returned pointer is NULL. If a malformed MXF file provides an unknown or invalid UL, mxf_get_codec_ul will return NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference and a crash when the code attempts to access members of the NULL pointer. This can result in a denial of service."
