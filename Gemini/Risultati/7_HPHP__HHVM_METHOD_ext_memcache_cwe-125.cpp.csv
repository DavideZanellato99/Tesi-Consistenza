"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code uses `snprintf` to construct a key string into a fixed-size buffer `stats_key` (30 bytes). While `snprintf` prevents buffer overflows by truncating the output if it exceeds the buffer size, it returns the number of characters that *would have been written* if the buffer had been large enough, *excluding* the null terminator. The subsequent call `String(stats_key, key_len, CopyString)` then uses this `key_len` value (which can be larger than the actual content in `stats_key`) as the length for creating a new string. If `key_len` is greater than the actual capacity of `stats_key` (i.e., `sizeof(stats_key) - 1`), this will cause the `String` constructor to attempt to read data beyond the allocated bounds of the `stats_key` buffer, leading to a buffer over-read. This can result in crashes, undefined behavior, or potentially information disclosure."

"3","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code uses `snprintf` to format a string into a fixed-size buffer `stats_key` of 30 bytes. The return value of `snprintf`, `key_len`, indicates the number of characters that *would have been written* if the buffer was large enough, excluding the null terminator. If the formatted string (hostname:port) is longer than 29 characters, `snprintf` truncates the output, but `key_len` will still reflect the original, untruncated length. Subsequently, `String(stats_key, key_len, CopyString)` is called. If truncation occurred, `key_len` will be larger than the actual valid data stored in `stats_key` (which is at most 29 characters plus a null terminator). Passing this larger `key_len` to the `String` constructor will cause it to read past the end of the `stats_key` buffer, leading to a buffer over-read. This can result in information disclosure (reading sensitive data from adjacent memory) or potentially a crash if the read memory is unmapped or protected."
