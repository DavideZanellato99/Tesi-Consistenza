"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code uses sprintf to format an IP address string into the fixed-size buffer addr. The integer values a, b, c, and d are parsed from user input via sscanf. If these integer values are sufficiently large, their string representation can exceed the allocated size of the addr buffer (INET_ADDRSTRLEN), leading to a buffer overflow. The sscanf function's return value is not checked, meaning that if parsing fails, a, b, c, or d could contain uninitialized or arbitrary values, further increasing the risk of an overflow when sprintf is called."
