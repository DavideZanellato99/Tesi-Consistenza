"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, which can cause a buffer overflow.","The memcpy call copies insn_len bytes from insn to ctxt->fetch.data without validating that insn_len does not exceed the allocated size of ctxt->fetch.data. An attacker controlling insn_len could provide a value larger than the buffer's capacity, leading to a buffer overflow and potential memory corruption or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, which can cause a buffer overflow.","The code performs a memcpy operation from an untrusted source buffer 'insn' to 'ctxt->fetch.data' using 'insn_len' as the size. There is no bounds checking to ensure that 'insn_len' does not exceed the allocated size of 'ctxt->fetch.data'. If an attacker can control 'insn_len' and provide a value larger than the buffer's capacity, it will result in a buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
