"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this condition. This can lead to other weaknesses such as buffer overflows.","The code casts `ut32` values read from `data` into signed `int` for `min_val` and `max_val`. If the `ut32` values exceed `INT_MAX`, they will be converted to negative `int` values. Subsequently, the calculation `max_val - min_val` can result in a signed integer overflow if `max_val` is `INT_MAX` and `min_val` is `INT_MIN` (due to `ut32` values like `0x7FFFFFFF` and `0x80000000` respectively). Signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C/C++, which can lead to unpredictable program behavior, incorrect logic, or crashes, making it a security vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not sufficiently control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code processes a table switch where the number of cases is derived from min_val and max_val read from input data. Although there is a check ((max_val - min_val)<(UT16_MAX/4)) to limit the number of cases, this limit (approximately 16,384 cases) is still substantial. Inside the loop, r_anal_switch_op_add_case is called for each case, which likely involves memory allocation. An attacker could craft input data that sets max_val - min_val close to this limit, causing the function to allocate a large number of RAnalCaseOp objects. Repeatedly processing such malformed input could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially exhausting system resources and resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application."
