"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code accesses the 'snes_op' array using 'data[0]' as an index without validating that 'data[0]' (an unsigned 8-bit integer, 0-255) is within the bounds of the 'snes_op' array. If 'snes_op' is an array with fewer than 256 elements, a crafted 'data[0]' value could lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing a crash, denial of service, or disclosure of sensitive information."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the JSR (0x20), JMP (0x4c), and JMP ($ffff) (0x6c) instruction handling cases, the code attempts to read data[1] and data[2] to construct an address. However, it does not check if the provided 'len' parameter is sufficient (i.e., at least 3 bytes) before accessing these array elements. If 'len' is less than 3, this will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."
