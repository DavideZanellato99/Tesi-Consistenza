"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a certain size. This can introduce other weaknesses when the computation exceeds the size of the integer and wraps around to a significantly smaller number, or becomes a negative number.","The code snippet contains an integer truncation vulnerability. The 'symbol->size' field, which is of type 'ut64' (unsigned 64-bit integer), is assigned to an 'int' variable 'len' without proper bounds checking. If 'symbol->size' holds a value greater than 'INT_MAX', it will be truncated. This truncated 'len' is then used in calls to 'is_in_range', which expects a 'ut64' size. This can lead to incorrect range calculations, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass address-based filtering or cause other logic errors by manipulating symbol sizes in a crafted binary."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource. This can lead to a denial of service or other system instability.","The code processes symbol names from binary files and stores them in internal data structures (RFlagItem and RAnalMeta) without apparent length restrictions. An attacker could craft a binary with an extremely large number of symbols, each having an excessively long name. When the `bin_symbols` function iterates through these symbols, it allocates memory for escaped names and then stores copies of these potentially very long names in the RFlagItem (via r_flag_set) and RAnalMeta (via r_meta_add) structures. This uncontrolled allocation and storage of large strings can lead to excessive memory consumption, causing a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting system memory and crashing the application or making it unresponsive."
