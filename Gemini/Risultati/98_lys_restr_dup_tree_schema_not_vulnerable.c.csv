"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The function iterates 'size' times, accessing 'old[i]' without validating that the 'old' array contains at least 'size' elements. If the caller provides a 'size' value larger than the actual allocated size of 'old', an out-of-bounds read will occur, leading to undefined behavior such as crashes or information disclosure."

"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The function `lys_restr_dup` iterates `size` times, accessing `old[i]` in each iteration. The `size` parameter dictates the number of elements to be read from the `old` array. However, there is no validation to ensure that the `old` array actually contains at least `size` elements. If a malicious or erroneous caller provides a `size` value that exceeds the actual allocated or valid bounds of the `old` array, the loop will attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory region for `old`. This constitutes an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to crashes, disclosure of sensitive information from adjacent memory, or unpredictable program behavior."
