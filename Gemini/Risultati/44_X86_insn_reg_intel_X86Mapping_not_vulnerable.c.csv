"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs concurrent actions on a shared resource without properly synchronizing the actions. This can lead to a race condition, which can produce unexpected results.","The code contains a race condition during the one-time initialization of the 'insn_regs_intel_sorted' array. The 'intel_regs_sorted' static flag is used to ensure 'memcpy' and 'qsort' are called only once, but it is not protected by a synchronization mechanism (e.g., mutex). If multiple threads call this function concurrently before the flag is set to true, they might all enter the initialization block, leading to concurrent 'memcpy' and 'qsort' operations on the same shared array. This will result in data corruption within 'insn_regs_intel_sorted', causing subsequent binary searches to return incorrect results or potentially crash."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read if the `insn_regs_intel` array (and consequently `insn_regs_intel_sorted`) has a size of zero. In this scenario, `ARR_SIZE(insn_regs_intel) - 1` would result in an unsigned integer underflow, setting `last` to `UINT_MAX`. Subsequently, the condition `insn_regs_intel_sorted[0].insn > id || insn_regs_intel_sorted[last].insn < id` would attempt to access `insn_regs_intel_sorted[0]` and `insn_regs_intel_sorted[UINT_MAX]`, both of which are out-of-bounds for an empty array, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential information disclosure."
