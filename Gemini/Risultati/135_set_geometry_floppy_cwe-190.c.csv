"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds writes. The 'type' and 'drive' parameters, used as array indices for 'floppy_type', 'floppy_sizes', 'user_params', and 'current_type' arrays, lack sufficient bounds checking. An attacker, even with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges, could provide a crafted 'type' or 'drive' value that exceeds array boundaries, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution in the kernel."

"5","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The integer variable 'type' is used as an index for the 'floppy_type' and 'floppy_sizes' arrays without sufficient bounds checking. Specifically, within the 'if (type)' block, 'floppy_type[type]' and 'floppy_sizes[cnt]' (where 'cnt' is derived from 'type << 2') are accessed. If an attacker can provide a value for 'type' that is outside the allocated memory range for these arrays, it will result in an out-of-bounds write. This memory corruption can lead to a denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
