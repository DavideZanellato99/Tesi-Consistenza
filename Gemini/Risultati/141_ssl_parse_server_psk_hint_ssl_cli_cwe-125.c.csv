"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs bounds checks before reading the length field and before advancing the pointer by the specified length. The maximum length value is 65535, which is handled safely by size_t and pointer arithmetic. No actual data is read or copied based on the length, only the pointer is advanced. There are no apparent buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory safety issues."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly parses a length-prefixed field from a buffer. It performs two crucial bounds checks: first, to ensure there are enough bytes to read the 16-bit length field, and second, to ensure that the data indicated by the read length does not extend beyond the provided buffer end. The pointer `*p` is advanced appropriately after each step. The maximum length (65535) is small enough to prevent integer overflow in pointer arithmetic on typical systems. No out-of-bounds reads, writes, or other common vulnerabilities are present."
