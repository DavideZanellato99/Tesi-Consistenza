"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows in multiple switch cases. In the LY_TYPE_IDENT case, both sprintf and strcpy are used to copy user-controlled or derived string data into a fixed-size buffer (buf) without checking if the source string length exceeds the buffer's capacity. Similarly, in the LY_TYPE_DEC64, LY_TYPE_INT*, and LY_TYPE_UINT* cases, sprintf is used to format potentially large integer values into buf without any bounds checking, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write if the formatted string is longer than buf_len."
