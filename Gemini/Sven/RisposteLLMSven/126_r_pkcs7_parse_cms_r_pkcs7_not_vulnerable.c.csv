"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code snippet processes data parsed by `r_asn1_create_object` without re-validating that the `sector` and `length` fields of the extracted sub-objects remain strictly within the bounds of the original `buffer` and `length` provided to the function. If a malicious input can cause `r_asn1_create_object` to return an `RASN1Object` where `sector` + `length` for any sub-object (specifically `object->list.objects[0]` or `object->list.objects[1]->list.objects[0]`) extends beyond the original `buffer`'s boundaries, then subsequent calls to `r_asn1_stringify_oid` and `r_pkcs7_parse_signeddata` will result in out-of-bounds reads, potentially leading to information disclosure, crashes, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected program behavior if the call fails.","The code does not check the return values of `r_asn1_stringify_oid` and `r_pkcs7_parse_signeddata`. If `r_asn1_stringify_oid` fails (e.g., due to memory allocation issues) and returns NULL, `container->contentType` will be NULL, but the function proceeds and returns the container. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the caller attempts to use `container->contentType` without validation. Similarly, if `r_pkcs7_parse_signeddata` fails (e.g., due to malformed input or memory issues), its failure is not detected, potentially leaving `container->signedData` in an invalid or partially initialized state. This can result in crashes, undefined behavior, or memory leaks if resources allocated by `r_asn1_stringify_oid` are not properly freed upon subsequent failures."
