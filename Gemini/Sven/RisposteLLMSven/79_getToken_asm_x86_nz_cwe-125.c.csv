"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer.","The code performs character access on the input string str using indices *begin and *end without explicit bounds checking against the actual length of the string. The loops rely on encountering a null terminator or a non-matching character to stop. If the input string str is not null-terminated, or if its allocated buffer is smaller than the logical string length, these operations can read past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In the loops that skip whitespace and identify word and number tokens, the pointers *begin and *end are incremented without checking if they exceed the bounds of the input string str. This allows str[*begin] or str[*end] to read past the null terminator of str and into adjacent memory, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or undefined behavior."
