"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet demonstrates proper resource management and error handling. It allocates cryptographic resources (RNG and skcipher) and registers a key type. In case of any failure during these operations, it correctly jumps to cleanup labels (error_cipher, error_rng) to free any resources that were successfully allocated up to that point, preventing memory leaks. The use of goto statements for cleanup is a standard and accepted pattern in the Linux kernel for managing resource lifetimes."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet demonstrates proper resource allocation and deallocation with robust error handling. It correctly allocates a cryptographic random number generator and a symmetric key cipher, assigning them to global variables. In case of any allocation or registration failure, the code uses goto statements to jump to appropriate cleanup labels, ensuring that any previously allocated resources (RNG or cipher) are freed before returning an error code. There are no apparent memory leaks, resource leaks, use-after-free issues, or unhandled error conditions within this snippet."
