"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences (or similar constructs) that can resolve to a location outside of that directory.","The code constructs a file path by appending the result of getFilename() to a user-controlled path _path if _path is identified as a directory. If getFilename() returns a string containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../), an attacker could manipulate the final path to write files outside the intended extraction directory. This could lead to overwriting arbitrary files on the system or placing malicious files in sensitive locations."

"5","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or absolute pathnames that could allow the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The `_path` parameter, which is user-controlled, is concatenated with `getFilename()` without proper sanitization for directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This combined path is then passed to `SystemUtilities::oopen()`. An attacker could provide a malicious `_path` or a malicious filename (if `getFilename()` is derived from archive contents) to cause files to be written or accessed outside the intended directory, leading to arbitrary file write or information disclosure."
