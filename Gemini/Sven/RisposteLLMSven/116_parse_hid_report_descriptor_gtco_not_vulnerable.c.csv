"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The `indentstr` buffer is declared with a size of 10 characters. The `indent` variable, which controls the index for writing into `indentstr`, is incremented when a `TAG_MAIN_COL_START` tag is encountered. There is no check to ensure that `indent` remains within the bounds of `indentstr` (i.e., less than 10) before `indentstr[x] = '-';` or `indentstr[x] = 0;` operations are performed. A specially crafted HID report descriptor containing more than 9 nested `TAG_MAIN_COL_START` tags without corresponding `TAG_MAIN_COL_END` tags could cause `indent` to exceed 9, leading to an out-of-bounds write to `indentstr[10]` or beyond. This could corrupt adjacent memory, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
