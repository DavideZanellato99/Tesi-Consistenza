"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The `addPeer` function processes `ip` and `reason` strings without any explicit length validation. While these strings are HTML-escaped (mitigating Cross-Site Scripting if displayed in a web context), an attacker could provide arbitrarily long strings for `ip` and `reason`. Storing these extremely long strings in the `m_peers` vector, even with a `MAX_LOG_MESSAGES` limit on the number of entries, could lead to excessive memory consumption. Furthermore, the `Utils::String::toHtmlEscaped` operation would consume more CPU time for longer strings. If many such requests are processed, this could result in CPU exhaustion, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by exhausting system resources."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the calculation is used to determine a memory allocation size, a loop counter, or an array index, or when the result of the calculation is used in a security-sensitive context.","The `peerCounter++` operation increments a counter that is used to assign a unique identifier to each log entry. If `peerCounter` is a fixed-size integer type (e.g., `int`, `long`) and the application processes an extremely large number of peers over its lifetime, this counter could experience an integer overflow. An integer overflow would cause the counter to wrap around, leading to the generation of duplicate identifiers. If these identifiers are used in security-sensitive contexts, such as for data retrieval, access control, or auditing, duplicate IDs could lead to data integrity issues, incorrect log correlation, or potentially allow an attacker to reference or manipulate unintended log entries."
