"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. After the initial 18 bytes are read from the stream, if the BITMAP_COMPRESSION flag is set and the NO_BITMAP_COMPRESSION_HDR flag is not set, the function attempts to read an additional 8 bytes (four UINT16 values) for compression header data. However, there is no preceding check to ensure that at least 8 bytes remain in the stream before these reads. An attacker could provide a crafted input stream that is too short for these conditional reads, causing the Stream_Read_UINT16 operations to read past the end of the allocated stream buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs an initial length check for 18 bytes to read the fixed-size header. However, if the BITMAP_COMPRESSION flag is set and NO_BITMAP_COMPRESSION_HDR is not set, the code attempts to read an additional 8 bytes (4 UINT16 values) for compression-related fields without performing a subsequent length check. If the remaining stream length after the initial 18 bytes is less than 8, these conditional reads will attempt to access data beyond the bounds of the input stream, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
