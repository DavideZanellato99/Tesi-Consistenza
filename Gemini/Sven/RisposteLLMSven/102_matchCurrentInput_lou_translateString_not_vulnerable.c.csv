"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code accesses passInstructions[passIC + 1] without any prior bounds checking against the actual size of the passInstructions array. If passIC + 1 is an index outside the valid range of passInstructions, an out-of-bounds read will occur. The value read from this potentially invalid memory location is then used to calculate the loop's upper bound for k, which can lead to further out-of-bounds reads when passInstructions[k] is accessed within the loop, potentially causing information disclosure or a crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code accesses array elements using indices `pos` and `passIC` without proper bounds checking. Specifically, if `pos` is a negative integer, `input->chars[pos]` will result in an out-of-bounds read. Similarly, if `passIC` is a negative integer, `passInstructions[passIC + 1]` and `passInstructions[passIC + 2]` will result in out-of-bounds reads."
