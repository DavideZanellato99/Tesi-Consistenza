"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously ascertained to be NULL, or that could be NULL under some circumstances. This can lead to a crash (denial of service) or other undefined behavior.","The function does not perform null pointer checks for the `data` and `header` arguments. If either `data` or `header` is a null pointer, and the `data_size` and `header_size` parameters allow the `memcmp` function to be called (i.e., `data_size >= header_size` and `header_size > 0`), a null pointer dereference will occur. For example, if `data` is NULL, `&data[i]` will attempt to dereference NULL. Similarly, if `header` is NULL and `header_size > 0`, `memcmp` will attempt to read from a null address. This can lead to a crash (denial of service) or other undefined behavior."

"4","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","An off-by-one error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few. This can cause buffer overflows, read/write errors, or other unexpected behavior. In this specific case, the loop iterates one time too few, leading to a logical error where a valid match for the header might be missed, resulting in incorrect program behavior.","The loop condition `for (long i=0; i < data_size - header_size; i++)` contains an off-by-one error. This condition prevents the search from checking for a potential match that starts at the very end of the `data` buffer, specifically at index `data_size - header_size`. If the `header` matches the last possible segment of the `data` (i.e., starting at `data[data_size - header_size]`), or if the `header` is exactly the same size as the `data` and matches, the function will incorrectly return -1 (not found) instead of the correct starting position (which would be `data_size - header_size` or `0` respectively). The loop should iterate up to and including `data_size - header_size` to cover all possible starting positions for the header."
