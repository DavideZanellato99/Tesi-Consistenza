"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a double-free vulnerability. When iconInfo->cbBitsMask or iconInfo->cbBitsColor is zero, realloc is called with a size of zero. According to the C standard, realloc(ptr, 0) is equivalent to free(ptr). If realloc then returns NULL (a common behavior), the subsequent error handling block `if (!newBitMask)` will attempt to `free` the same pointer again, leading to a double-free. This applies to `iconInfo->bitsMask` and `iconInfo->bitsColor` if they were previously non-NULL."
