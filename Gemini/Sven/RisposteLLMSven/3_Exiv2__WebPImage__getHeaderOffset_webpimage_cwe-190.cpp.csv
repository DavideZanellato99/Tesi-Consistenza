"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or information disclosure.","The function uses `memcmp` to compare a `header` buffer of `header_size` bytes. If `header_size` is controlled by an attacker and exceeds the actual allocated size of the `header` buffer, `memcmp` will attempt to read data beyond the bounds of the `header` buffer. This buffer over-read can lead to denial of service (crashes) or information disclosure by leaking sensitive data from adjacent memory regions. The function does not validate the relationship between the `header` pointer and its provided `header_size` against the actual memory allocated for `header`. While the `data` buffer is protected from over-read by the loop condition, the `header` buffer is not."
"2","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","An off-by-one error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few. This can cause buffer overflows, buffer underflows, or other unexpected behavior. In this specific case, the loop iterates one time too few, preventing the detection of a pattern at the very end of the search space, which is a common manifestation of this weakness.","The loop condition `for (long i=0; i < data_size - header_size; i++)` contains an off-by-one error. The loop should iterate up to and including the index `data_size - header_size` to correctly check for a header that starts at the very end of the `data` buffer. With the current condition, the loop stops one iteration too early, meaning if the target `header` is located at the last possible starting position (i.e., `data[data_size - header_size]`), the function will fail to find it and return -1. This can lead to incorrect program behavior, denial of service, or other issues depending on how the function's return value is utilized."
