"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The code performs a memcpy(&priv->ctrl, p, sizeof(priv->ctrl)) operation where the source pointer p is derived from a void * argument (priv_cfg). There is no size validation performed on the data pointed to by p before the memcpy. If the caller provides a priv_cfg that points to a buffer smaller than sizeof(priv->ctrl), this will result in an out-of-bounds read from the source buffer p, potentially leading to a kernel crash, data corruption, or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The code performs a memcpy operation from 'p' to '&priv->ctrl' using 'sizeof(priv->ctrl)' as the size. If 'p' points to a user-controlled buffer that is smaller than 'sizeof(priv->ctrl)', this will result in an out-of-bounds read from the user's memory space, potentially leading to information disclosure or a kernel crash. Additionally, the 'strcmp(p->fname, priv->fname)' call could lead to an out-of-bounds read if 'p->fname' points to a user-controlled, non-null-terminated string."
