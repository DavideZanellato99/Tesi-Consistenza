The filename parameter is used to construct file paths without sufficient sanitization. The check for ""../"" is conditional on MAGICKCORE_INSTALLED_SUPPORT. If this macro is not defined, the check is entirely bypassed, allowing an attacker to provide a filename like ""../../../etc/passwd"" to access arbitrary files outside the intended module directory. Even when the ""../"" check is present, it is insufficient as it does not handle absolute paths or other forms of path manipulation."
