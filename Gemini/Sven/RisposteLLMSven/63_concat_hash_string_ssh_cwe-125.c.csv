"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The function concat_hash_string takes a character buffer buf as an argument without its size. It then copies attacker-controlled lengths of data from packet->payload into buf using strncpy and direct assignments. There are no checks to ensure that the total accumulated length of data written to buf (tracked by buf_out_len) does not exceed the actual allocated size of buf. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious packet with large length values, leading to an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) on the buf buffer."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to overwrite adjacent memory, leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior.","The function concat_hash_string performs multiple strncpy operations and character appends into a caller-provided buffer buf without knowing or checking its allocated size.
