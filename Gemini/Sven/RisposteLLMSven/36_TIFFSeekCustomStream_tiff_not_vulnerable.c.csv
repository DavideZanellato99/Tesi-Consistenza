"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the calculation is performed in a signed context, leading to a result that is outside the expected range. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect array indexing, or other unpredictable behavior.","The SEEK_END case in the TIFFSeekCustomStream function is vulnerable to a signed integer overflow. When calculating the new offset as profile->length + offset, if both profile->length and offset are large positive values, their sum can exceed the maximum value representable by MagickOffsetType. This results in a signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C/C++. The existing check 'if (((MagickOffsetType) profile->length+offset) < 0)' only catches cases where the overflow wraps around to a negative value. If the overflow wraps to a positive value, the check will not trigger, and profile->offset will be set to an incorrect, potentially much smaller, positive value. This can lead to incorrect stream positioning, causing data corruption, unintended data disclosure, or other logical errors in subsequent I/O operations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a small positive or negative number, which can have numerous consequences, such as an out-of-bounds write.","The SEEK_END case is vulnerable to integer overflow. The calculation profile->length+offset does not include robust checks for positive integer overflow. If the sum exceeds the maximum value of MagickOffsetType, it results in undefined behavior. This could lead to the offset being set to an incorrect, potentially small positive value, which could cause out-of-bounds access or other security issues. The existing check only catches cases where the overflow results in a negative value, but not when it wraps to an incorrect positive value."
