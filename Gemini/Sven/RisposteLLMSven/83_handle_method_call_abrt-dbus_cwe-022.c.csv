"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or absolute pathnames in the input. This allows an attacker to access or create files outside of the restricted directory.","The code directly uses untrusted input from D-Bus method parameters such as problem_dir, problem_id, and element in various file system operations including opening, reading, writing, changing ownership, and deleting files and directories. Although helper functions like allowed_problem_dir and open_directory_for_modification_of_element are invoked, their implementations are not provided within this snippet. If these crucial helper functions fail to rigorously validate and sanitize the user-supplied paths to prevent directory traversal sequences (e.g., ""../"") or absolute pathnames, an attacker could exploit this to manipulate file system operations on arbitrary files and directories outside the intended restricted scope. This could lead to severe consequences such as unauthorized information disclosure, arbitrary file write, arbitrary file deletion, or privilege escalation."
"2","True","CWE-285","Improper Authorization","The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.","The 'Quit' D-Bus method can be invoked by any D-Bus client without any authorization checks. This allows an unprivileged attacker to terminate the service, leading to a denial of service."
