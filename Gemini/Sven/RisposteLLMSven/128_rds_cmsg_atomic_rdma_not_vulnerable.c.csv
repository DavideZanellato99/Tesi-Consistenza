"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial of service, depending on how the invalid input is processed.","The code processes a cmsghdr structure where the cmsg_type field is user-controlled. The switch statement handles specific RDS_CMSG_ATOMIC_* types, but the default case calls BUG(), which triggers a kernel panic and results in a denial of service. A malicious user can provide an arbitrary cmsg_type value that does not match any expected case, thereby crashing the system."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The code snippet passes the user-controlled 'args->local_addr' value, obtained from a control message, to the 'rds_pin_pages' function without explicitly validating that this address points to user-space memory. Although 'rds_pin_pages' is expected to perform necessary address validation (e.g., using access_ok or get_user_pages), the lack of explicit validation in this snippet creates a dependency on the correctness of 'rds_pin_pages'. If 'rds_pin_pages' or its underlying mechanisms fail to adequately validate the address, a malicious user could provide a kernel address, potentially leading to a kernel memory disclosure or corruption through subsequent RDMA operations on the pinned page. This is a common vulnerability pattern in kernel code interacting with user-supplied addresses."
