"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, accessing memory that it does not own, which can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.","The code calls r_str_escape_utf8 to process symbol->name. If r_str_escape_utf8 fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL. The code then proceeds to use this potentially NULL pointer (r_symbol_name) in strcmp(r_symbol_name, name) without a prior NULL check, leading to a null pointer dereference and a crash. Additionally, in IS_MODE_JSON mode, if r_symbol_name is NULL, r_str_escape_utf8_for_json will return NULL, and this NULL value (str) is then passed to r_cons_printf with a %s format specifier, which also results in a null pointer dereference. Similarly, in IS_MODE_SIMPLE and IS_MODE_SIMPLEST modes, if both sn.demname and r_symbol_name are NULL, the resulting name pointer will be NULL and passed to r_cons_printf with %s, leading to a crash."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C/C++ code snippet appears to be robust and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. Memory allocations using functions like r_str_escape_utf8, r_str_newf, strdup, construct_symbol_flagname, __filterShell, and r_str_escape_utf8_for_json are consistently paired with corresponding free calls, preventing memory leaks or double-frees. Input strings are either escaped or used in contexts that prevent format string vulnerabilities or command injection. Null pointer dereferences are generally guarded by explicit checks. Integer types are used appropriately, and no obvious integer overflows leading to security issues are present. The use of library functions such as r_flag_set, r_flag_item_set_realname, and r_meta_add is assumed to involve string copying to prevent use-after-free issues, which is standard practice in the radare2 framework from which this code originates."
