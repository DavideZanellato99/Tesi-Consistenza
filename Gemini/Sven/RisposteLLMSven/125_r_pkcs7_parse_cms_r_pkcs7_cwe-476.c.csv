"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check for or incorrectly handles a return value from a function call, which can lead to unexpected program behavior or vulnerabilities.","The return value of r_asn1_stringify_oid is not checked for NULL. If r_asn1_stringify_oid fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, container->contentType will be assigned NULL. The function then proceeds to return the container object, which now contains a NULL pointer for contentType. Subsequent attempts by the caller to dereference container->contentType without a NULL check will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location.
