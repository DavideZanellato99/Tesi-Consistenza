"1","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software uses a file name or path that is provided by an untrusted source. This can lead to a variety of issues, including arbitrary file access, directory traversal, or execution of unintended files, if the path is not properly sanitized or validated.","The code processes problem_data, which may come from an untrusted source. Inside a loop, when an item with the CD_FLAG_BIN flag is encountered, its value->content field is used as the source path for a copy_file operation. While the destination filename ('name') is validated using str_is_correct_filename, the source path (value->content) is not validated or restricted. An attacker can supply an arbitrary path for value->content (e.g., ""/etc/passwd""), causing the application to read the content of any file on the system that the process has read permissions for and copy it into the dump directory. This leads to an arbitrary file read vulnerability and potential exposure of sensitive information."
"2","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software constructs a file name or path using an input from an untrusted source, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the input that could modify the path's meaning. This can allow an attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the system.","The `value->content` field, which can be controlled by an external entity via `problem_data`, is used as the source path for the `copy_file` function without proper validation. An attacker can specify an arbitrary sensitive file path (e.g., /etc/shadow) in `value->content`, causing its contents to be copied into the created dump directory, leading to information disclosure."
