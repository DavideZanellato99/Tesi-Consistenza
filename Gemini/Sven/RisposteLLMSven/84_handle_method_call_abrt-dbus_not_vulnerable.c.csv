"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code snippet is vulnerable to multiple issues. In the GetInfo and FindProblemByElementInTimeRange methods, the 'element' parameter is directly used in file system operations (dd_load_text_ext, get_problem_dirs_for_element_in_time) without proper validation like 'str_is_correct_filename', which is used for similar parameters in other methods (SetElement, DeleteElement). This allows an attacker to supply path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) to read arbitrary files or search for elements outside the intended problem directories. Additionally, the Quit method lacks any authorization checks, allowing any D-Bus client to shut down the service, leading to a denial of service. There is also a potential path traversal vulnerability in ChownProblemDir and DeleteProblem if the 'allowed_problem_dir' function does not adequately validate the 'problem_dir' parameter against directory traversal attacks."
"2","True","CWE-285","Improper Authorization","The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.","The 'Quit' D-Bus method lacks any authorization checks. Any D-Bus client can invoke this method, which calls g_main_loop_quit(loop), leading to the termination of the service. This constitutes a Denial of Service vulnerability."
