"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has been previously initialized to NULL, leading to a crash or exit.","The code reassigns the `expr` pointer with `expr = expr->action.args;` within the `EXPR_ACTION_DECL` block. If `expr->action.args` is a NULL pointer, then `expr` will become NULL. This potentially NULL `expr` pointer is then passed to the `ExprResolveModMask` function. If `ExprResolveModMask` does not perform a NULL check on its `expr` parameter before dereferencing it, a NULL pointer dereference will occur, leading to a crash or denial of service. The initial NULL check for `expr` at the beginning of `ResolveStateAndPredicate` does not cover the case where `expr` becomes NULL due to this reassignment."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid memory address (NULL). This typically causes a program crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The code snippet is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. In the EXPR_ACTION_DECL branch, the result of xkb_atom_text is assigned to pred_txt. If xkb_atom_text returns NULL, pred_txt will be NULL. This NULL pointer is then passed directly to LookupString without a preceding NULL check. If LookupString does not handle NULL input gracefully and attempts to dereference pred_txt, it will lead to a program crash or denial of service. This is in contrast to the EXPR_IDENT branch, which correctly checks pred_txt for NULL before use."
