"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two numbers is calculated, and the result is stored in a data type that is too small to hold the result, leading to a loss of precision or an unexpected value. This can happen when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the destination type, or when it falls below the minimum value.","The function performs left-shift operations (1<<(number-1) and 1<<number) without validating the 'number' parameter. If 'number' is negative or greater than or equal to the bit width of an 'int' (e.g., 32 for a 32-bit int), these shift operations result in undefined behavior according to the C standard, which can lead to unexpected values, crashes, or other security vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for unusual or exceptional conditions, which can leave the product in an inconsistent state and/or allow an attacker to trigger a vulnerability.","The code snippet uses bitwise left shift operations (1<<(number-1) and 1<<number) without validating the 'number' parameter. According to the C standard, shifting by a negative amount or by an amount greater than or equal to the width of the promoted left operand (which is 'int', typically 32 bits) results in undefined behavior. Specifically, if 'number' is 0, 'number-1' is -1, leading to 1<<-1 which is undefined behavior. If 'number' is 32 or greater (for a 32-bit 'int'), 1<<number results in undefined behavior. Undefined behavior can lead to crashes, incorrect calculations, or other exploitable conditions."
