"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The program performs operations on a heap-allocated buffer, but it can write past the intended boundary of the buffer. This can corrupt adjacent data, lead to a crash, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code allocates fixed-size arrays (red, green, blue) of 65536 uint16 elements to store colormap data. However, the loop that populates these arrays iterates up to 'image->colors', which is a size_t type and can hold a value larger than 65536. If a crafted image has 'image->colors' greater than 65536, an out-of-bounds write will occur on the heap when accessing 'red[i]', 'green[i]', or 'blue[i]', leading to a heap buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product uses a heap buffer to contain data, but the product can write past the end of the buffer. This can lead to corruption of adjacent data, denial of service, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. In the PHOTOMETRIC_PALETTE case, the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' colormap arrays are allocated with a fixed size of 65536 elements (uint16). However, the loop populating these arrays iterates up to 'image->colors'. If 'image->colors' (which is of type size_t) is greater than 65536, an out-of-bounds write will occur when 'i' exceeds the allocated buffer size, writing past the end of the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' arrays on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
