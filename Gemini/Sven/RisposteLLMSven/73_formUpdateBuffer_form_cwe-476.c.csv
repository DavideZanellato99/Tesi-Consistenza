"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be allocated or assigned, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function formUpdateBuffer dereferences the Anchor *a parameter without checking if it is NULL. Specifically, the call to gotoLine(buf, a->start.line) will cause a null pointer dereference and a program crash if a is NULL when the function is invoked."

"4","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an excessive amount of data to a heap-based buffer, which can overwrite adjacent memory. This can lead to corruption of data, crashes, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code calls the external function form_update_line to modify a line buffer (l->lineBuf) using content from 'p', which is derived from form->value->ptr or form->label->ptr. While the code checks that the target update range (spos to epos) is within the current line's data length (l->len), it does not explicitly check if the length of the new content 'p' will fit within the allocated capacity of l->lineBuf. If form_update_line does not properly reallocate l->lineBuf when the new content 'p' is longer than the space available, or if it miscalculates the required size, it could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. Since 'p' can originate from user-controlled input (e.g., form values), an attacker could provide an overly long string to trigger this overflow, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other security impacts."
