"1","True","CWE-59","Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')","The software attempts to access a file based on a supplied pathname, but it does not properly prevent the pathname from resolving to a symlink or hardlink that points to an unintended location. This can allow an attacker to read, write, or execute files in arbitrary locations on the file system.","The code is vulnerable to a symlink attack (CWE-59). While it attempts to prevent path traversal within the archive's filenames, it does not prevent the extraction process from following symbolic links on the host filesystem. An attacker could create a symbolic link within the destpath (or make destpath itself a symlink) that points to an arbitrary location on the file system. When the UnZip function then creates directories using QDir::mkpath or files using QFile within this symlinked path, it would write to the attacker-controlled location, potentially overwriting sensitive system files or creating files in unintended locations. The QDir::mkpath and QFile operations do not verify that the resolved path remains within the intended extraction directory, allowing for arbitrary file write/overwrite."

"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not adequately control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code extracts files from a zip archive without imposing limits on the total uncompressed size or the number of files. A malicious zip archive (a ""zip bomb"") could contain extremely large files or a very large number of files, leading to excessive disk space consumption or inode exhaustion on the target system. This can result in a denial of service by filling up the filesystem or making the system unresponsive."
