"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code calculates the 'filesize' variable directly from untrusted input (magick[0], magick[1], magick[2]) without any validation or bounds checking. This 'filesize' value then controls the number of bytes read from the input image and written to a temporary file. An attacker can craft a malicious image file where these bytes are set to their maximum values, leading to an excessively large 'filesize' (up to approximately 16MB per 'slide'). Since the code processes multiple 'slides' in a loop, this can result in the creation of an extremely large temporary file, potentially exhausting disk space on the system and causing a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not adequately control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code calculates a 'filesize' based on three bytes read from the input image data (magick[0], magick[1], magick[2]). This 'filesize' determines the number of bytes subsequently read from the input and written to a temporary file. An attacker can control these input bytes, leading to an arbitrarily large 'filesize' (up to 16MB per block). If the input file contains multiple such blocks, the temporary file can grow excessively large, potentially filling the disk partition and causing a denial of service due to resource exhaustion."
