"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overrun the output buffer.","The function `concat_hash_string` copies data into the `buf` parameter using `strncpy` and appends characters without knowing the allocated size of `buf`. The `len` values used for copying are read from the input packet, and the total accumulated length written to `buf` is not checked against `buf`'s capacity. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious `packet->payload` that causes the function to write beyond the bounds of the `buf` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."

"5","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The function concat_hash_string takes a character buffer buf as an argument without any corresponding size parameter. It then proceeds to read length values from the packet->payload and uses these lengths in multiple strncpy calls and direct character assignments to append data to buf. The length values are controlled by the input packet, and while there are checks to prevent reading beyond the packet->payload bounds, there are no checks to ensure that the total accumulated length (buf_out_len) does not exceed the allocated size of the buf buffer. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious packet with large length values, leading to an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) on the buf buffer."
