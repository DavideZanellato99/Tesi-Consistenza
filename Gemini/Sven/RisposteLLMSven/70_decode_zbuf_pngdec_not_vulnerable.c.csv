"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The decode_zbuf function decompresses data using zlib into an AVBPrint buffer. The AVBPrint buffer is initialized with av_bprint_init(bp, 0, -1), which sets the maximum buffer size to UINT_MAX (typically 4GB). An attacker can provide a specially crafted, small compressed input (a ""decompression bomb"") that expands to an extremely large amount of data, potentially up to 4GB. This can lead to excessive memory allocation, exhausting system resources, and causing a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application or the entire system."
