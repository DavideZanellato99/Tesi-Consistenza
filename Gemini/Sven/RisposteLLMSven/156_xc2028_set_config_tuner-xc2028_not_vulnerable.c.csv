"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code performs a memcpy operation from priv_cfg (aliased as p) to &priv->ctrl using sizeof(priv->ctrl) as the size. The priv_cfg argument is a void *, and there is no size validation performed on the buffer it points to before the memcpy. If the caller provides a priv_cfg that points to a buffer smaller than sizeof(struct xc2028_ctrl), the memcpy will read past the end of the provided buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure (leaking kernel memory) or a denial of service (kernel crash)."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The code performs a memcpy operation using sizeof(priv->ctrl) as the size, but the source pointer p (derived from priv_cfg) is a generic void * with no size validation. If the buffer pointed to by p is smaller than sizeof(priv->ctrl), the memcpy will read past the end of the source buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
