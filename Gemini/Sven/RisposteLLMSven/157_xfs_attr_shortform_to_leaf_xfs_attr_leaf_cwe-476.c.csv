"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code copies shortform attribute data into a temporary buffer of size determined by sf->hdr.totsize. It then iterates through entries in this buffer using sf->hdr.count and individual entry lengths (namelen, valuelen). If an attacker crafts a filesystem image where sf->hdr.totsize is smaller than the actual total size required by the sum of all entry lengths, the loop will read past the end of the allocated temporary buffer (tmpbuffer), leading to an out-of-bounds read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code calculates the size for a memcpy operation from sf->hdr.totsize, where sf initially points to ifp->if_u1.if_data. If the value of sf->hdr.totsize, which is derived from filesystem metadata, is greater than the actual allocated size of ifp->if_u1.if_data (ifp->if_bytes), the memcpy will read data beyond the bounds of the if_u1.if_data buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious or corrupted filesystem image."
