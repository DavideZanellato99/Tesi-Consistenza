"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code fails to validate the size of the input buffer pSrcData (specified by the 'length' parameter) before passing it to freerdp_image_copy in the uncompressed data path. The freerdp_image_copy function will attempt to read DstWidth * DstHeight * GetBytesPerPixel(SrcFormat) bytes from pSrcData. If 'length' is less than this required amount, freerdp_image_copy will read beyond the allocated bounds of pSrcData, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. Additionally, the calculation DstWidth * DstHeight * GetBytesPerPixel(SrcFormat) itself could suffer from integer overflow if DstWidth, DstHeight, and GetBytesPerPixel(SrcFormat) are large, especially on systems where size_t is 32-bit. An overflow would result in an undersized calculated required length, making any subsequent bounds check ineffective and still leading to an out-of-bounds read."
"2","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, an intended buffer.","The code does not adequately validate the size of the source buffer (pSrcData) against the amount of data that freerdp_image_copy will attempt to read. In the uncompressed path, freerdp_image_copy is called to copy image data. This function will attempt to read DstWidth * DstHeight * GetBytesPerPixel(SrcFormat) bytes from pSrcData. The snippet does not perform a check to ensure that this calculated read size does not exceed the provided SrcSize (which is the 'length' parameter). If the required read size is greater than SrcSize, freerdp_image_copy will perform an out-of-bounds read from pSrcData, leading to a buffer over-read."
