"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be exploited by an attacker to consume an excessive amount of resources, leading to a denial of service.","The code uses ParseProtoUnlimited to deserialize a protobuf message from a 'value' string. If the 'value' string, which is retrieved from storage, can be controlled or influenced by an attacker to contain an arbitrarily large protobuf message, ParseProtoUnlimited will attempt to allocate memory for the entire message without a size limit. This could lead to excessive memory consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting available memory."

"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow.","The function `CopySliceData` copies data into a caller-provided buffer `T* data` based on the dimensions specified by the `TensorSlice slice` parameter. If an attacker can manipulate the `slice` parameter to specify a region larger than the actual memory allocated for `data` by the calling function, the subsequent call to `CopyDataFromTensorSliceToTensorSlice` will write data beyond the allocated buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. This could lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. Additionally, if the `slice_s` object (derived from potentially untrusted input) specifies a larger source region than the actual data available in `sts.data().data()`, an out-of-bounds read could occur."
