"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. The `in_backprop_tensor_temp_mat` is initialized with `in_depth` as its first dimension. However, the loop iterating over the depth dimension uses `out_depth` (`for (int64_t d = 0; d < out_depth; ++d)`). If `out_depth` is greater than `in_depth`, the access `in_backprop_tensor_temp_mat.coeffRef(d, in_index)` will attempt to write data beyond the allocated bounds of the matrix, leading to memory corruption or a crash. There is no validation to ensure that `out_depth` and `in_depth` are equal."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. The loop iterates 'd' from 0 to 'out_depth - 1' to access 'in_backprop_tensor_temp_mat.coeffRef(d, in_index)'. However, 'in_backprop_tensor_temp_mat' is an Eigen map initialized with 'in_depth' rows. If 'out_depth' (derived from user-controlled 'out_backprop.dim_size(3)') is greater than 'in_depth' (derived from user-controlled 'orig_input_tensor_shape_flat(3)'), the loop variable 'd' will exceed the valid row indices of 'in_backprop_tensor_temp_mat', leading to an out-of-bounds write to the underlying memory buffer. There is no validation to ensure 'in_depth == out_depth'. Additionally, a division by zero vulnerability exists if user-controlled 'row_seq_tensor_flat(r+1)' is less than or equal to 'row_seq_tensor_flat(r)' (or similarly for columns), causing 'num_elements_in_pooling_cell' to become zero."
