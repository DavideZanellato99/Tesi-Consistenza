"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this overflow, which can lead to resultant vulnerabilities.","The variable total_inputs_size accumulates the byte size of all input tensors. This variable is of type size_t. If the sum of value->TotalBytes() for all inputs exceeds the maximum value representable by size_t, an integer overflow will occur. This overflow will cause total_inputs_size to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. This potentially malicious smaller value is then passed to the CreateNodeDef function. If CreateNodeDef uses this total_inputs_size to allocate memory or determine buffer sizes, an attacker could exploit the overflow to cause a heap buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues by providing inputs that cause the sum to wrap around, leading to an undersized allocation."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The `total_inputs_size` variable accumulates the byte sizes of all input tensors. If the sum of these sizes exceeds the maximum value representable by `size_t`, an integer overflow will occur, causing `total_inputs_size` to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. This potentially incorrect size is then passed to the `CreateNodeDef` function. If `CreateNodeDef` uses this value for memory allocation or bounds checking, it could lead to a heap buffer overflow, denial of service, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities."
