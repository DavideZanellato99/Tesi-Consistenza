"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs character comparisons by indexing into rex.line using col + len2. The len2 variable accumulates byte lengths of characters read from rex.line without explicit bounds checking against the actual size or length of the rex.line buffer. If the match_text is longer than the remaining portion of rex.line from col, or if col is already near the end of the line, PTR2CHAR(rex.line + col + len2) will attempt to read memory beyond the allocated buffer for rex.line, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs reads from 'rex.line + col + len2' without sufficient bounds checking. The 'col' and 'len2' variables are incremented based on character lengths, but there is no explicit verification that 'col + len2' remains within the allocated size of the 'rex.line' buffer. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing information leakage, a denial of service (crash), or incorrect program behavior."
