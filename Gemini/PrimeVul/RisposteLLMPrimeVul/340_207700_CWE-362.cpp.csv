"1","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle exceptional conditions, which can lead to a denial of service, data loss, or other consequences.","The code handles the case where an ID is not found by invoking STFATAL. If STFATAL causes the termination of the process or a critical thread, an attacker could repeatedly request non-existent IDs, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application. Allowing user input to trigger a fatal error without proper recovery mechanisms constitutes a vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code attempts to retrieve information for a given ID. If the ID is not found in the map, it invokes STFATAL. Assuming STFATAL causes the program to terminate or crash, an attacker could repeatedly request non-existent IDs, leading to frequent application crashes and thus a Denial of Service. While the check prevents an invalid iterator dereference, the chosen error handling mechanism introduces a vulnerability by allowing an attacker to control the application's uptime."
