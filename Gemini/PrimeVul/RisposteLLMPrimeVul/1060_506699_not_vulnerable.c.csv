"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. Memory is allocated using OPENSSL_malloc and freed using OPENSSL_free within the loop, preventing memory leaks. String lengths are correctly calculated using strlen, and memcpy operations include the null terminator, avoiding buffer overflows. The OpenSSL certificate checking functions (X509_check_host, X509_check_email) are called with the correct string and length arguments. There are no apparent use-after-free, double-free, or uninitialized memory issues."

This typically causes a program crash or exit, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code does not check if OPENSSL_malloc returns NULL before dereferencing the 'name' pointer in memcpy. If memory allocation fails, 'name' will be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a program crash, resulting in a denial of service."
