"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code uses STRLEN(string) to determine the length of the input 'string' without explicitly ensuring that 'string' is a null-terminated string. If 'string' points to a buffer that does not contain a null terminator within its allocated bounds, STRLEN (which is typically a macro for strlen) will read past the end of the buffer until a null byte is encountered or an invalid memory access occurs. This leads to an out-of-bounds read, which can result in a crash (denial of service) or potentially information disclosure by reading unintended memory contents."
