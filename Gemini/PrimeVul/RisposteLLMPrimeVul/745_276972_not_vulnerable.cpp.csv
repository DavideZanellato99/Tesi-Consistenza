"1","True","CWE-323","Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption","The product reuses a nonce or key pair in a cryptographic operation, which can weaken the security of the operation. For example, if a nonce is reused with the same key in a stream cipher, then the same keystream will be generated, which can allow an attacker to recover the plaintext by XORing the two ciphertexts.","The code uses AES-128 in CBC mode, which requires a unique and unpredictable Initialization Vector (IV) for each encryption operation with the same key. The Create method accepts the iv as a parameter, placing the responsibility for generating a cryptographically secure, unique IV entirely on the caller. If the caller provides a static, predictable, or reused IV, the encryption scheme becomes vulnerable to attacks such as chosen-plaintext attacks or information leakage, where relationships between plaintexts can be deduced. The code itself does not enforce the security requirements for the IV, making it susceptible to misuse."
"2","True","CWE-327","Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","The product uses a cryptographic algorithm that is known to be broken or to have a high degree of risk. This can include algorithms that are no longer considered secure due to advances in cryptanalysis, or algorithms that are inherently weak or have known vulnerabilities when used in certain contexts.","The SampleEncrypter::Create method accepts an initialization vector (IV) as a parameter and uses it for CBC mode encryption. It is critical that a unique and unpredictable IV is used for each encryption operation with the same key. This method does not generate a secure random IV internally nor does it enforce that the provided IV is cryptographically secure. If the caller provides a predictable, reused, or non-random IV, it can lead to serious cryptographic vulnerabilities like plaintext leakage, compromising the confidentiality of encrypted data."
