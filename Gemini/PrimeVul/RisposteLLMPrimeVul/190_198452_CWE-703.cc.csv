"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than the maximum value, or smaller than the minimum value, that can be represented in the allocated memory. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows if the resulting value is used in memory allocation or indexing.","The code calculates quantization parameters including multipliers and shifts for fixed-point arithmetic. These parameters are derived from floating-point scales and are passed to downstream comparison functions. If the QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp function or the subsequent arithmetic operations within the comparison functions do not adequately handle the range of these parameters and input data, integer overflows or underflows can occur. Such overflows can lead to incorrect comparison results or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two numbers is calculated, and the result is stored in a data type that is too small to hold the result, leading to a loss of precision or unexpected behavior. When an integer overflow occurs, the excess most significant bits are lost, and the remaining least significant bits are stored. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations, buffer overflows, or denial of service.","The code calculates input1_offset = -input1->params.zero_point; and input2_offset = -input2->params.zero_point;. If input1->params.zero_point or input2->params.zero_point is the minimum representable value for a signed integer type (e.g., INT_MIN for int32_t), negating it results in an integer overflow, which is undefined behavior in C and C++. This can lead to an incorrect input_offset value being used in subsequent calculations within the reference_ops functions, potentially causing incorrect comparison results, data corruption, or denial of service."
