"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses strcpy to copy the pipePath string into the local.sun_path buffer without checking its length. The sun_path member of the sockaddr_un structure has a fixed, limited size (e.g., 108 bytes on Linux). If the pipePath string, obtained from endpoint.name(), exceeds this fixed buffer size, strcpy will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause a denial of service (program crash) or, in more sophisticated attacks, could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, causing a buffer overflow.","The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `pipePath` into `local.sun_path`. The `sockaddr_un.sun_path` field has a fixed, limited size (typically 108 bytes on Linux, including the null terminator). If the `pipePath` string obtained from `endpoint.name()` is longer than this buffer's capacity, `strcpy` will write past the end of `local.sun_path`, leading to a buffer overflow. This can corrupt adjacent memory, crash the application, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution."
