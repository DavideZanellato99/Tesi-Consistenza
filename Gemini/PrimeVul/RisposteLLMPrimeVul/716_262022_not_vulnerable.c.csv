"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet safely iterates through a list using G_N_ELEMENTS to prevent out-of-bounds access. It uses g_strcmp0 for string comparison, which gracefully handles NULL inputs, preventing null pointer dereferences. The function performs a read-only lookup and does not involve any operations that could lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities within the scope of this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet safely iterates through a fixed-size list and uses g_strcmp0 for string comparison, which handles NULL pointers gracefully. The loop bounds are correctly checked using G_N_ELEMENTS, preventing out-of-bounds access. No memory safety issues, integer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities are apparent."
