"1","True","CWE-703","Improper Control of Resource Identifiers","The product does not properly control or initialize a resource identifier, which can lead to incorrect resource management, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.","The code calls va_start twice on the same va_list variable 'ap' without an intervening va_end or va_copy. This constitutes undefined behavior according to the C standard, leading to improper control of the variadic argument list resource. This can result in unpredictable program execution, including crashes (Denial of Service), incorrect argument parsing by vsnprintf (potentially leading to information disclosure or other unexpected behavior), or other severe runtime errors. Additionally, there is a potential out-of-bounds read if WARN_TEXTWIDTH is greater than the 'print_buffer' size (256), and a denial-of-service vulnerability due to an infinite loop if the text wrapping logic causes 'len' to not decrease when 'cut' is 0."

"3","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","A buffer over-read occurs when a program reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains a buffer over-read vulnerability. In the text wrapping loop, the variable len is incorrectly decremented by cut instead of cut + 1 after fwrite writes cut + 1 characters. This off-by-one error causes ptr to advance beyond the print_buffer boundary while len is still positive, leading to an out-of-bounds read when fputs(ptr, config->errors) or ISSPACE(ptr[cut]) is called in a subsequent loop iteration. Additionally, calling va_start twice on the same va_list without an intervening va_end is undefined behavior."
