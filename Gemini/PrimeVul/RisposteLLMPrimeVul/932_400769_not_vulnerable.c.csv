"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other exploitable conditions.","The code relies on the `page_copy_sane` function to validate the `offset` and `bytes` parameters. If `page_copy_sane` does not robustly check for integer overflow when summing `offset` and `bytes`, an attacker could provide values that cause an integer wraparound. This wraparound could result in a sum that appears to be within page boundaries, bypassing the sanity check. Subsequently, `kaddr + offset` would point to an address far outside the intended page, leading to an out-of-bounds write when `_copy_from_iter` attempts to write `bytes` data."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the result of the calculation will always be within a certain range. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other weaknesses.","The code relies on the `page_copy_sane` function to validate the `offset` and `bytes` parameters. If `page_copy_sane` performs its bounds check by summing `offset` and `bytes` (e.g., `offset + bytes <= PAGE_SIZE`), an integer overflow could occur if `offset` and `bytes` are sufficiently large. This overflow would cause the sum to wrap around, potentially bypassing the intended bounds check and allowing the `_copy_from_iter` function to write data out-of-bounds relative to the `page` buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow."
