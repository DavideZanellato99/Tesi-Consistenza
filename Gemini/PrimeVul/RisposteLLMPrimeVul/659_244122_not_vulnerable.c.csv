"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code uses strlen(ptr->string) to determine the length of data to write. If ptr->string is not guaranteed to be a null-terminated string, strlen will read past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer over-read. This can cause a denial of service (crash) or information disclosure by reading sensitive data from adjacent memory locations."

"5","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type, which can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or crashes.","The code performs an unchecked downcast from GF_Box *s to GF_SphericalVideoInfoBox *ptr. If s does not point to an object of the expected type, accessing ptr->string will lead to type confusion, potentially causing an out-of-bounds read, information disclosure, or a denial of service due to memory corruption or a crash."
