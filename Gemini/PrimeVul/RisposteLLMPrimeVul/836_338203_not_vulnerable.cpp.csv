This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code snippet performs a bounds check `index >= wasm.tables.size()`. However, if the `Index` type is a signed integer, a negative value for `index` would bypass this check, as a negative number is not greater than or equal to a non-negative size. This would lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `wasm.tables[index]` with a negative index, resulting in undefined behavior or a crash."
