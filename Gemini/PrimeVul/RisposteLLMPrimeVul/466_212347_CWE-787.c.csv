"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without checking that the input buffer is smaller than the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The STRCAT(IObuff, "": ""); call at the beginning of the function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. STRCAT does not perform bounds checking, meaning if the IObuff buffer is already nearly full, appending the string "": "" (which is 3 bytes including the null terminator) could write past the allocated memory for IObuff. This can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other memory corruption issues. Although subsequent operations within the loop attempt to check for buffer boundaries, this initial STRCAT operation is unprotected."
