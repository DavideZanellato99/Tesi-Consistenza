"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function returns NULL, which, if not properly checked by the caller, can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when the returned pointer is used. This can result in application crashes or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has a NULL value, which typically causes a program crash or exit.","The function `const_ptr_mysql_time()` is implemented to always return `NULL`. Any code that calls this function and attempts to dereference the returned pointer without first checking if it is `NULL` will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash (Denial of Service)."
