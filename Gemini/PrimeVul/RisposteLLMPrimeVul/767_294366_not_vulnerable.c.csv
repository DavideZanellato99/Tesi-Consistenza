"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than the maximum size that can be held within the available memory storage. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect calculations, buffer overflows, or security vulnerabilities.","The code performs date and time calculations, converting Julian Day differences to seconds. If the underlying VALUE type used to store the number of seconds is a fixed-size integer and the calculated time difference (in seconds) exceeds its maximum representable value, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to incorrect time values, potentially causing logic errors, security bypasses, or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product uses or calculates a number that is larger than the maximum value intended for storage in a specified data type, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other unintended behavior.","The code performs arithmetic operations on VALUE types. If VALUE is a fixed-size integer type, the f_add function could lead to an integer overflow if the sum of 's' and 'df' exceeds the maximum representable value for VALUE. This would result in incorrect time calculations."
