"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory address and is currently NULL. This typically causes a program crash or denial of service.","The code does not check if the 'data' pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. If 'data' is NULL, multiple assignments like 'data->fr_bd_cb' will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The input parameter 'queue' is an integer and is used as an array index for 'trans_pcie->rxq'. While an upper bound check (queue >= trans->num_rx_queues) is performed, there is no check to ensure that 'queue' is non-negative. A negative value for 'queue' would result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."
