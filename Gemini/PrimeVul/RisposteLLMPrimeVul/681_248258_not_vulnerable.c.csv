"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The for loop `for (i = 0; opts[i].name; i++)` iterates through an array of `cfg_opt_t` structures. The loop termination condition `opts[i].name` relies on the implicit assumption that the `opts` array is properly terminated with a `cfg_opt_t` element where the `name` member is `NULL`. If the `opts` array is not correctly null-terminated, or if `opts` points to a single structure instead of a properly terminated array, the loop could read beyond the allocated memory boundary, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This could result in a denial of service (crash) or information disclosure from adjacent memory locations."
