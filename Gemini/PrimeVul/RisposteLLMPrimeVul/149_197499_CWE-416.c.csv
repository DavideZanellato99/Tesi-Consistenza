"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code reads NbBits (up to 5 bits) and then nbFields (up to NbBits bits) from the bitstream. The nbFields value directly controls the size of memory allocations via gf_sg_vrml_mf_alloc and the number of iterations in subsequent loops. An attacker can provide a large NbBits value (e.g., 31) and then a large nbFields value (up to 2^31 - 1), leading to excessive memory allocation and/or prolonged CPU-intensive processing within the loops. This can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system resources."
"2","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a heap-based buffer that is smaller than the input buffer, causing a buffer overflow. This can be caused by incorrect size calculations, integer overflows, or other logic errors.","The code reads a length NbBits (up to 31) and then nbFields (up to 2^31 - 1) from a bitstream. This nbFields value, which is attacker-controlled, is used to allocate memory via gf_sg_vrml_mf_alloc and to control the loop iterations. If nbFields is sufficiently large, the internal calculation for the total allocation size within gf_sg_vrml_mf_alloc (e.g., nbFields * sizeof(item)) can suffer from an integer overflow, resulting in a much smaller buffer being allocated than intended. Subsequently, the for loop iterates nbFields times, and operations like gf_sg_vrml_mf_get_item and gf_node_list_add_child_last will attempt to write or read beyond the bounds of the undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."
