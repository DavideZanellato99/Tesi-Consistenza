"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet implements a regular expression matching engine with several robust mechanisms to prevent common vulnerabilities. It includes checks for excessive memory usage (using 'p_mmp' and 'ga_grow'), mechanisms to interrupt long-running matches (via 'fast_breakcheck', 'got_int', and 'profile_passed_limit'), and specific logic to prevent infinite loops in backreferences ('BACK' case). String comparisons ('cstrncmp') are performed with explicit lengths, and pointer arithmetic for input advancement and backtracking includes boundary checks (e.g., 'rex.input > rex.line', 'rex.input == rex.line', 'rex.lnum == 0'). Multibyte character handling also appears to be implemented with length awareness. The code handles unexpected regex program structures by reporting internal errors rather than crashing. Based on the visible logic and defensive programming practices, no obvious security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or denial-of-service due to catastrophic backtracking are present in this snippet."
"2","True","CWE-1333","Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity","The product uses a regular expression that is inefficient, which allows an attacker to provide a specially crafted input that causes the regular expression engine to consume an excessive amount of CPU or memory, leading to a denial of service.","The code implements a backtracking regular expression engine, which is inherently susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities. Backtracking engines can exhibit exponential time complexity for certain 'catastrophic backtracking' patterns when matched against specific input strings. While the code includes mitigations such as a timeout mechanism (profile_passed_limit) and a memory limit for the internal regex stack (p_mmp), these only limit the impact of such patterns by terminating the operation after a certain duration or memory usage, rather than eliminating the underlying exponential time complexity. An attacker could still craft inputs that trigger these resource-intensive computations, leading to temporary resource exhaustion and a denial of service."
