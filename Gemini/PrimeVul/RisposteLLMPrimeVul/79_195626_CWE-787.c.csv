"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.","The memcpy operation copies 'len' bytes from 'buf' to 'elem.in_sg[0].iov_base' without validating that 'len' is within the bounds of the destination buffer. There is no check against the actual size of 'elem.in_sg[0].iov_base' (e.g., 'elem.in_sg[0].iov_len'). If an attacker can control the 'len' parameter and provide a value larger than the buffer's capacity, it will result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
