"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. If the input equation results in an empty set of input strings (num_inputs is 0) but a non-empty set of output labels (num_labels is greater than 0), the final loop attempts to access (*input_label_counts)[0]. Since input_label_counts is resized to num_inputs (which is 0), this access is an out-of-bounds read on an empty vector, leading to undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. If the parsed equation results in an empty input_str, num_inputs will be 0. Consequently, input_label_counts will be resized to 0. Later, in the loop mapping labels to DimensionType, the expression (*input_label_counts)[0][label] is evaluated. Accessing index 0 on an empty input_label_counts vector constitutes an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior."
