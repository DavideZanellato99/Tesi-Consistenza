"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of the intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. Multiple operations increment the 'dest' pointer based on attacker-controlled input values ('skip', 'count', 'opcode') without sufficient bounds checking against the total size of the 'dest' buffer ('flxdec->size'). Specifically, 'dest += flxdec->hdr.width * skip;', 'dest += flxdec->hdr.width;', 'dest += skip;', and repeated '*dest++' operations can cause 'dest' to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can craft malicious input data to trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code contains two out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. First, within the line skip processing, the dest pointer is advanced by flxdec->hdr.width * skip bytes without sufficient bounds checking. Although skip is checked against flxdec->hdr.height, the cumulative effect of skip and the current line index can cause dest to point beyond the allocated dest buffer. Second, in the ""last pixel"" processing, if the current line is the last line of the frame, dest is advanced by flxdec->hdr.width bytes, placing it one byte past the end of the buffer, and then a byte is written to this out-of-bounds location. Both scenarios allow an attacker to write data outside the intended buffer."
