"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code snippet calls mrb_obj_as_string on the separator and implicitly on array elements within join_ary. If the separator or any array element is an object with a user-defined to_s method, a malicious implementation of to_s could be invoked. This could lead to excessive memory allocation (e.g., returning an extremely long string) or CPU consumption (e.g., performing a very slow computation or an infinite loop), resulting in a denial of service. Additionally, a recursive to_s implementation could lead to a stack overflow."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The mrb_obj_as_string function converts an mrb_value to its string representation. If the sep object is controlled by an attacker and its to_s method or equivalent internal conversion logic is designed to produce an extremely large string or is computationally expensive, calling mrb_obj_as_string could lead to excessive memory allocation or CPU usage. This could exhaust system resources, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application. The code snippet does not implement any size or complexity limits on the resulting string, making it susceptible to resource exhaustion."
