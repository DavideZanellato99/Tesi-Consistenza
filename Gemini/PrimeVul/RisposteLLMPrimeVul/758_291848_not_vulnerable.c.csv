"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code dereferences the input pointer 'con' and its derived pointers 'clt_path' and 'clt' multiple times without performing any NULL checks. If 'con' is a NULL pointer, or if 'to_clt_path(con->c.path)' returns NULL, or if 'clt_path->clt' is NULL, the subsequent dereferences will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a system crash or denial of service."

"4","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.","The code passes the address of a stack-allocated variable (msg) as private_data to rdma_connect_locked. If rdma_connect_locked or any subsequent asynchronous operation attempts to access this private_data after the rtrs_rdma_route_resolved function returns, the msg variable will be out of scope. This leads to a use-after-free vulnerability, as the memory location previously occupied by msg may be reused, causing unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potential information disclosure or arbitrary code execution."
