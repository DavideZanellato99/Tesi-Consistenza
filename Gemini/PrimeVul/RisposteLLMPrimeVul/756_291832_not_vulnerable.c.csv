"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code iterates up to clt_path->queue_depth to free resources. If clt_path->queue_depth is larger than the actual allocated size of the clt_path->reqs array, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing clt_path->reqs[i]. This can lead to dereferencing invalid pointers (req->mr, req->sge, req->iu), potentially causing crashes, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability arises if the queue_depth value can be manipulated or becomes inconsistent with the allocated buffer size."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code iterates `clt_path->queue_depth` times, accessing `clt_path->reqs[i]`.
