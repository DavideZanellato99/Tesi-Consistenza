"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that it receives from an untrusted source. This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the context, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or command injection.","The code allows input_min_tensor and input_max_tensor to have dimensions 0 or 1. However, when axis_ == -1, the code attempts to access these tensors using scalar<T>(). The scalar<T>() method is intended for 0-dimensional tensors. If input_min_tensor or input_max_tensor has dimension 1 (which is permitted by the OP_REQUIRES check), calling scalar<T>() on it will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs an out-of-bounds read. If 'axis_' is not -1, the code attempts to access 'input_min_tensor.dim_size(0)' and 'input_max_tensor.dim_size(0)'. However, the preceding validation allows 'input_min_tensor.dims()' and 'input_max_tensor.dims()' to be 0. If a tensor has 0 dimensions (i.e., it's a scalar), accessing 'dim_size(0)' is an invalid operation, leading to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause a crash or undefined behavior."
