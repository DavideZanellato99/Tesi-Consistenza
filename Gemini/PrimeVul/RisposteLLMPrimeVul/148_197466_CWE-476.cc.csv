"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The restore_index parameter is used to access elements from context->input(1) and context->input(2) without any bounds checking. An attacker controlling restore_index could provide an out-of-bounds value, leading to an out-of-bounds read from memory. This could result in information disclosure or a denial of service."
