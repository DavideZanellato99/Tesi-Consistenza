"1","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The product uses recursion without sufficiently limiting the recursion depth, which can lead to a stack overflow. This can result in a denial of service or, in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution if the stack overflow can be controlled.","The xml_parse_node function is recursive and calls itself when parsing processing instructions, comments, and nested XML elements. An attacker can craft an XML document with an excessively deep nesting of these constructs, such as <?a?><?b?><?c?>... or <a><b><c>...</a></b></a>, which will lead to uncontrolled recursion. This will exhaust the program's call stack, resulting in a stack overflow and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the computation is used as a buffer size or offset.","The code is vulnerable to an integer underflow/wraparound in the attribute value parsing. Specifically, the line `attr->value.slen -= 2;` attempts to remove quote characters from the string length. If `attr->value.slen` (which is typically an unsigned type like `size_t`) is less than 2 (e.g., 0 or 1) due to malformed input, this operation will cause an integer underflow. This underflow will wrap `attr->value.slen` around to a very large positive number. Combined with `++attr->value.ptr;`, this can lead to subsequent operations on `attr->value` (such as memory copies or comparisons) reading or writing out-of-bounds, potentially causing buffer overflows, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the recursive calls for processing instructions and comments (`return xml_parse_node(pool, scanner);`) can lead to a stack overflow and denial of service if an attacker provides a specially crafted XML input with a large number of such elements."
