"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs null pointer checks for 'symbol' and 'symbol->type' before accessing their members. The 'strcmp' function is used appropriately for string comparisons, and there are no apparent buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other common memory safety issues. The logic correctly validates a symbol based on its physical address and type."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs null pointer checks for 'symbol' and 'symbol->type' before dereferencing them. The 'strcmp' function calls are used appropriately for string comparisons and do not introduce buffer overflows or other memory safety issues. No other apparent vulnerabilities like integer overflows, format string issues, or race conditions are present in this snippet."
