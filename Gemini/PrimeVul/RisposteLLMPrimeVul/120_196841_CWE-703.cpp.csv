"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds reads and writes. The 'chans' parameter is used as the upper bound for a loop that accesses 'patCache[j]', 'e->song.chanShow[j]', and 'patChanX[j]'. If 'chans' exceeds the actual allocated size of these arrays, it will result in out-of-bounds memory access. Similarly, the calculation of 'index' for 'pat->data[i][index]' and 'pat->data[i][index+1]' depends on 'e->song.pat[j].effectRows'. If 'e->song.pat[j].effectRows' is too large, it can lead to out-of-bounds reads from 'pat->data[i]'. These issues can be triggered by a malicious input for 'chans' or a malformed song file, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Unrestricted External Input')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior.","The code uses sprintf with a fixed-size static buffer 'id' of 32 bytes. The call sprintf(id,""%s##PN_%d_%d"",noteName(pat->data[i][0],pat->data[i][1]),i,j); passes the return value of the 'noteName' function as a string argument. If 'noteName' returns a string longer than the remaining capacity of the 'id' buffer (after accounting for the format string and integer values), it will lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing memory corruption or denial of service. The length of the string returned by 'noteName' is not checked against the buffer's capacity."
