"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product allocates memory during program execution, but it does not free the memory after it has finished being used. This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory, eventually causing the program or system to crash or become unstable.","The code allocates ClientUsageTracker objects using 'new' and stores raw pointers in 'client_tracker_map_'. There is no visible corresponding 'delete' operation or use of smart pointers to manage the lifetime of these dynamically allocated objects. This will lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory will not be freed when the UsageTracker object is destroyed or when entries are removed from the map."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program allocates memory from the heap, but it does not free the memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to memory exhaustion and denial of service.","The constructor allocates ClientUsageTracker objects on the heap using 'new' and stores raw pointers to them in 'client_tracker_map_'. Without a corresponding 'delete' operation in the UsageTracker destructor or the use of smart pointers (like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to manage the lifetime of these allocated objects, memory will be leaked when the UsageTracker object is destroyed."
