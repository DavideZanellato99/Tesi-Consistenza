While fsPath has some logic to restrict its scope, the fsFileName variable, which is likely derived from user-controlled input (e.g., an uploaded file's original name), is directly appended without any sanitization or validation for path traversal sequences. An attacker could provide a fileName_ containing "".."" or absolute path components to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, bypassing intended directory restrictions."
