"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The line `si->sps = &avc->sps[si->pps->sps_id + GF_SVC_SSPS_ID_SHIFT];` uses an index derived from `si->pps->sps_id`, which is a value parsed from the input bitstream. There are no bounds checks performed on `si->pps->sps_id` or the resulting sum before it is used to access the `avc->sps` array. An attacker can craft a malicious bitstream with a large `sps_id` value, causing an out-of-bounds read from `avc->sps`. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code uses si->pps->sps_id as an index into the avc->sps array without proper bounds checking. An attacker can craft a malicious bitstream with an out-of-range sps_id value, leading to an out-of-bounds read when accessing avc->sps[si->pps->sps_id + GF_SVC_SSPS_ID_SHIFT]. This can result in a denial of service (crash) or potentially information disclosure or arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and subsequent usage of the corrupted si->sps pointer."
