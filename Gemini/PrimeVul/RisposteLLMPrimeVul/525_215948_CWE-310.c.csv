"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or information disclosure.","The code snippet contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Inside the loop, functions like mpn_submul_1, cnd_sub_n, and cnd_add_n are called with p->m as a source buffer and hardcoded lengths (2, 1, and 3 respectively). The largest hardcoded length is 3. If the p->size member of the ecc_modulo structure is less than 3, specifically when cnd_add_n is called with a length of 3, the code will attempt to read beyond the allocated bounds of the p->m array. This can lead to information disclosure by reading adjacent memory or a denial of service due to a crash."

"5","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index","The product uses an array index that can be manipulated to point to a location outside of the intended array, leading to a read or write of unintended memory. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code performs array accesses using indices derived from 'n' and 'p->size'. Specifically, expressions like 'rp + n - 4', 'rp + n - 3', and 'rp[n-2]' are used within a loop where 'n' can be as small as 'p->size'. If 'p->size' is less than 4 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), these calculations will result in negative array indices, leading to a buffer underflow. The function does not validate that 'p->size' is sufficiently large to prevent these out-of-bounds accesses."
