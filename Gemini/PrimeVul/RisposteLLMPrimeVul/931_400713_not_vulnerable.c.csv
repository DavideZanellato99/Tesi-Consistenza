"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, which can lead to resultant vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or incorrect calculations.","The code uses unsigned integers for 'p_head' and 'i_head'. The 'while (p_head != i_head)' loop decrements 'p_head'. If 'i_head' is greater than the initial 'p_head', 'p_head' will underflow (wrap around to UINT_MAX) and continue decrementing until it eventually matches 'i_head' after a very large number of iterations. This leads to an uncontrolled resource consumption (Denial of Service) due to the extremely long loop. Furthermore, 'pipe_buf_release' will be called repeatedly on buffers that are not logically part of the pipe's current content, potentially leading to double-free vulnerabilities or other forms of memory corruption, depending on the implementation of 'pipe_buf_release'."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a certain size.","The code is vulnerable to an integer underflow that can lead to a denial-of-service. The `while (p_head != i_head)` loop decrements `p_head` (an `unsigned int`). If `p_head` is `0` and `i_head` is a numerically larger index (e.g., `ring_size - 1`), `p_head--` will cause `p_head` to underflow to `UINT_MAX`. This makes the loop run for an extremely large number of iterations, repeatedly releasing pipe buffers and consuming excessive CPU cycles, resulting in a denial-of-service."
