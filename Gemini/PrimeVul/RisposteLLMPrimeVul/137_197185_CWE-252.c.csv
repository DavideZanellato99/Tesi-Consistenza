"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code initializes a bit writer 'pb' with a fixed-size buffer 'adts->pce_data' of 'MAX_PCE_SIZE' bits. It then calls 'ff_copy_pce_data' to copy data from the input bitstream 'gb' to 'pb'. If 'ff_copy_pce_data' does not internally enforce the 'MAX_PCE_SIZE' limit when writing to 'pb', a specially crafted input bitstream could cause 'ff_copy_pce_data' to write beyond the allocated buffer 'adts->pce_data', leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. The current code does not perform any explicit bounds checking on the return value of 'ff_copy_pce_data' against 'MAX_PCE_SIZE' to prevent this."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code initializes a bitstream reader 'gb' from 'buf' with 'size * 8' bits. It then calls 'avpriv_mpeg4audio_get_config2' to parse configuration data, which returns the number of bits consumed as 'off'. This 'off' value is used by 'skip_bits_long' to advance the read pointer of 'gb'. If 'avpriv_mpeg4audio_get_config2' returns an 'off' value that exceeds the total available bits ('size * 8'), the 'gb' reader's internal pointer will be moved past the end of 'buf'. Subsequent operations like 'get_bits' and 'ff_copy_pce_data' will then attempt to read data from memory locations outside the allocated 'buf', resulting in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The code lacks a bounds check on the 'off' value before it is used to skip bits."
