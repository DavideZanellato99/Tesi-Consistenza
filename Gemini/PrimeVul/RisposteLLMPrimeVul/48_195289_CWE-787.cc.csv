"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code uses a value from user-controlled input (values_values) as an index into a data structure (per_batch_counts[batch][value]). The intended bounds check (value < maxlength_) is conditionally bypassed if maxlength_ is less than or equal to zero. If maxlength_ is not properly constrained and is <= 0, an attacker can provide a large positive value, leading to an out-of-bounds write if per_batch_counts is an array-like structure, or excessive memory allocation and denial of service if it's a map-like structure. This allows for potential memory corruption or resource exhaustion."
"2","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates resources based on an input that is not constrained, leading to excessive resource consumption.","The code uses 'value' from the input 'values' tensor. If the 'maxlength_' parameter is not properly constrained (e.g., set to zero or a negative value), an attacker can provide a 'values' tensor containing arbitrarily large positive integers. These large integers will be stored in 'max_value', which is then used to calculate 'num_output_values' via 'GetOutputSize'. This large 'num_output_values' is subsequently used by 'OutputSparse' to allocate an output tensor, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation and a denial-of-service condition."
