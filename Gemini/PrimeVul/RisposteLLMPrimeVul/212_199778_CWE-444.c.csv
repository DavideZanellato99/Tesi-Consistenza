"1","True","CWE-704","Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast","The program performs a type conversion or cast that causes a loss of precision, truncation, or misinterpretation of data, or that violates the intended immutability of data.","The code explicitly casts away the constness of the input buffer pointer 'p' (derived from 'buffer') before calling 'snake_upcase_char((char *)p);' within the 'tr21' and 'tr23' blocks. The 'buffer' parameter is declared as 'const char *', indicating that the function should not modify the data it points to. Modifying 'const' data leads to undefined behavior, which can result in crashes (e.g., segmentation fault if 'buffer' points to read-only memory) or data corruption. This violates the intended immutability of the input buffer. Additionally, the 'parser' pointer is dereferenced multiple times without a null check, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if a null 'parser' is passed."

"4","True","CWE-704","Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast","The program performs a type conversion or cast that causes a loss of precision, truncation, or misinterpretation of data, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This includes casting away constness, which can lead to unintended modifications of data.","The code snippet contains a const correctness violation. The 'buffer' parameter is declared as 'const char *', indicating that the function should not modify the contents of the buffer. However, the function calls 'snake_upcase_char((char *)p);' in states 'tr21' and 'tr23'. The explicit cast '(char *)p' removes the const qualifier, allowing 'snake_upcase_char' to modify the character pointed to by 'p', which is part of the input 'buffer'. If 'buffer' points to read-only memory (e.g., a string literal), this will result in a segmentation fault (Denial of Service). Even if the memory is writable, it violates the contract of the 'const' qualifier, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption if the caller expects the buffer to remain immutable."
