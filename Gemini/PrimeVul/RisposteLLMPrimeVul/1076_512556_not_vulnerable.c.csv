"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a constructor that delegates to a base class constructor. It does not perform any operations that could introduce a security vulnerability within itself. Any potential issues related to the handling of 'str' or 'str_length' would reside in the implementation of the 'Item_hex_constant' constructor, which is not part of this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a constructor definition that delegates to a base class constructor. It does not contain any direct operations or logic that introduce security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or improper resource handling. The parameters are passed correctly to the base class constructor, and no new vulnerabilities are introduced within this specific snippet."
