"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code reads two bytes from the input buffer and combines them into a 16-bit integer temp. This temp value is then used as an index into the rescale array. If the rescale array is not allocated to handle indices up to 65535, or if its size is based on a smaller maxval from the PGM header while the input data contains larger 16-bit values, an attacker can craft input that causes an out-of-bounds read from the rescale array. This can lead to a crash or information disclosure."
