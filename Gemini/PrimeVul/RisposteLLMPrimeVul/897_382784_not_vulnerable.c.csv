"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically leads to a crash or denial of service.","The code does not check if the memory allocation performed by gdMalloc was successful. If gdMalloc returns NULL, subsequent dereferences of the 'ctx' pointer (e.g., ctx->dp, ctx->ctx.getC) will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product accesses or dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which is NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code allocates memory using gdMalloc for 'ctx' but does not check if the allocation was successful. If gdMalloc returns NULL, 'ctx' will be a NULL pointer. Subsequent dereferences of 'ctx' (e.g., 'ctx->dp = dp;' and assignments to 'ctx->ctx' members) will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior. The return value of 'newDynamic' is also not checked, which could lead to 'ctx->dp' being NULL if 'newDynamic' fails, potentially causing further issues."
