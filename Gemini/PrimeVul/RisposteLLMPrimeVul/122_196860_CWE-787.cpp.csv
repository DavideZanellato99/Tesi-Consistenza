"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be exploited to consume an excessive amount of resources and potentially lead to a denial of service.","The code reads entry_count and global_entry_count from an untrusted bitstream and uses these values to control memory allocations in loops. While the first loop has a size check, it only prevents exceeding the remaining box size, not an excessive number of allocations that could lead to an out-of-memory condition or denial of service if the box size itself is large. The second loop, controlled by global_entry_count, lacks any such pre-validation, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large count to trigger uncontrolled memory allocations and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code reads entry counts (ptr->entry_count and ptr->global_entry_count) directly from the input bitstream and uses them to control loops that perform memory allocations. While there is a partial size check for ptr->entry_count, it only ensures the remaining box size is sufficient for the declared entries but does not cap the count to a reasonable maximum, allowing an attacker to specify an excessively large number of entries. For ptr->global_entry_count, there is no size validation at all before it is used to allocate memory in a loop. A malicious input file could specify very large entry counts, leading to numerous memory allocations and exhausting system memory, resulting in a Denial of Service."
