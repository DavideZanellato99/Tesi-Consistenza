"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically leads to a crash or exit, but could introduce other vulnerabilities.","The code dereferences the `hmhd` pointer at `hmhd->type` without first checking if `hmhd` is a valid non-NULL pointer. If `trak->Media->information->InfoHeader` is NULL, `hmhd` will be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a program crash. A check for `!hmhd` exists later in the function, but it is too late to prevent the initial dereference."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.","The code dereferences 'hmhd->type' without a prior null check for 'hmhd'. 'hmhd' is assigned the value of 'trak->Media->information->InfoHeader'. If 'InfoHeader' is null, 'hmhd' will be null, and the subsequent access 'hmhd->type' will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash. Additionally, there are no null checks for 'trak', 'trak->Media', or 'trak->Media->information' before their members are accessed, which could also lead to null pointer dereferences."
