"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without sufficiently checking that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer. This can cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.","The value for ptr->opcfg.OutputChannelCount is read directly from the input bitstream as an 8-bit unsigned integer. This untrusted value is then used as the size argument in the gf_bs_read_data function to copy data into the ptr->opcfg.ChannelMapping buffer. If the OutputChannelCount provided by a malicious or malformed input stream exceeds the actual allocated size of the ptr->opcfg.ChannelMapping buffer, a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other security impacts."
