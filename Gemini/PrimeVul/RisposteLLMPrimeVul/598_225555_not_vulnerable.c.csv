"1","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. This can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or arbitrary code execution.","The function TfLiteTensorReset stores raw pointers to externally provided data (name, dims, buffer) directly into the TfLiteTensor structure without making copies. This creates a dangling pointer vulnerability if the external memory is deallocated or goes out of scope prematurely. Subsequent access through these dangling pointers would result in a use-after-free condition, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This can lead to various issues including crashes, corruption of data, or arbitrary code execution, as the freed memory might be reallocated for other purposes or become invalid.","The function TfLiteTensorReset assigns raw pointers (name, dims, buffer, allocation) directly to members of the TfLiteTensor structure without making copies. If the caller deallocates or frees this memory while the TfLiteTensor object is still in use, any subsequent access to these pointers through the tensor object will result in a use-after-free vulnerability, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential arbitrary code execution."
