"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet potentially contains a double free vulnerability. The function free_mem_region(dev) is called, which might internally free the memory pointed to by dev->mem. Subsequently, rte_free(dev->mem) is called on the same pointer, which would result in a double free if free_mem_region indeed deallocates dev->mem. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet contains a potential double-free vulnerability. If the custom function `free_mem_region(dev)` frees the memory pointed to by `dev->mem`, then the subsequent call to `rte_free(dev->mem)` would attempt to free an already freed memory block. This double-free condition could lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
