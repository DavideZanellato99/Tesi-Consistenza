"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this condition. This can lead to resultant values that are outside the expected range, which can cause a variety of weaknesses including buffer overflows.","The code uses `int` pointers (`int *rjd`) to store and manipulate Julian Day numbers. Julian Day numbers can be very large, potentially exceeding the maximum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer. When arithmetic operations like `*rjd + d + 1` are performed, an integer overflow or underflow can occur if the intermediate or final result exceeds `INT_MAX` or falls below `INT_MIN`. This wraparound will lead to incorrect Julian Day calculations, which are then passed to `c_jd_to_civil`, resulting in incorrect date conversions, logical errors, and potentially undefined behavior or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that input.","The code attempts to normalize negative month values by adding 13. However, for certain negative inputs (e.g., m = -13 or m = -14), this operation can result in an invalid month value (0 or negative). These invalid month values are then passed to internal date calculation functions like c_find_ldom, c_jd_to_civil, and c_civil_to_jd without further validation, which could lead to incorrect calculations, out-of-bounds array access, crashes, or other undefined behavior depending on the implementation of those functions."
