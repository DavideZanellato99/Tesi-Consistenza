"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product or sum of two or more numbers is greater than the maximum value for the data type used to store the result, or less than the minimum value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The code contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the S_study_chunk function. Within the CURLY block, the calculation for 'delta' involves the expression '(minnext + deltanext) * maxcount'. The sum 'minnext + deltanext' is not checked for integer overflow before multiplication. If 'minnext' and 'deltanext' are large enough, their sum can exceed SSize_t_MAX, causing it to wrap around to a negative value. This leads to an erroneous calculation of 'delta', which can result in incorrect length computations for regular expressions, potentially causing incorrect memory allocations, out-of-bounds memory access, or a denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to an incorrect, typically smaller, result. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The code contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the CURLY block. When handling quantifiers, the calculation (mincount * l) + 1 for buffer allocation via SvGROW can overflow if mincount and l (both SSize_t) are sufficiently large. A signed integer overflow can wrap around to a smaller positive value. If this smaller value is then used by SvGROW to allocate an undersized buffer, subsequent calls to repeatcpy will attempt to write (mincount - 1) * l bytes, which could be a much larger amount than the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."
