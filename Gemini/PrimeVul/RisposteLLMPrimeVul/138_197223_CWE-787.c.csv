"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, corrupt data, or cause a denial of service.","The code calculates the length of the 'dir' component (plus an optional slash) and checks it against NJS_MAX_PATH. However, it fails to calculate and check the total combined length of 'dir' (plus optional slash) and 'info->name' before copying both parts into the fixed-size 'src' buffer. This allows an attacker to provide sufficiently long 'dir' and 'info->name' values such that their combined length exceeds NJS_MAX_PATH, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack-allocated 'src' buffer when njs_cpymem is called for 'info->name'. This can result in denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution."
