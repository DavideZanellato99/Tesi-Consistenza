"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The memset function is called with cmd->data and cmd->count without validating that the buffer pointed to by cmd->data is actually large enough to hold cmd->count bytes. If a caller provides a data buffer smaller than the requested count, the memset operation will write past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The checks on 'count' only ensure the logical request size is within limits or the export size, not the actual capacity of the 'data' buffer."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. The `memset(cmd->data, 0, cmd->count)` operation does not validate that the buffer pointed to by `cmd->data` is large enough to hold `cmd->count` bytes. If `cmd->data` points to a smaller buffer, this will result in an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory. Additionally, a memory leak occurs if `calloc` for `cmd` succeeds but an error path is taken before `cmd` is queued, as `cmd` is not freed."
