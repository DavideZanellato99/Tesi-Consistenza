"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is too large for the available storage space. This can result in a truncation of the most significant bits and lead to an unexpected value, which can then be used in security-critical decisions or memory operations.","The code calculates the product `memory_size * num_filters` which is then used in a `TF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ` check against `SizeOfDimension(state, 1)`. If `memory_size` and `num_filters` are sufficiently large, their product can overflow a 32-bit signed integer. If the `state` tensor's corresponding dimension also overflows to the same value, the `TF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ` check will pass, leading the system to incorrectly believe the `state` tensor is correctly sized. This can result in a heap buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access when the `state` tensor is later accessed using its intended larger logical size, as the actual allocated memory would be based on the smaller, overflowed dimension."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location, often resulting in a crash or denial of service.","The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. After calling TfLiteIntArrayCreate to allocate memory for node->temporaries, there is no check to ensure the allocation was successful. If TfLiteIntArrayCreate fails (e.g., due to memory exhaustion) and returns nullptr, the subsequent access to node->temporaries->data[0] will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a program crash and denial of service."
