"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The function calculates cmdlen by summing multiple u32 values. If the total sum of the lengths returned by iwl_pcie_tfd_tb_get_len across all iterations exceeds the maximum value representable by a u32 (UINT_MAX), an integer overflow will occur. This can cause cmdlen to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. If this truncated length is subsequently used for memory allocation or buffer size checks, it could lead to a heap buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption if the overflowed value is used in a subsequent memory operation.","The `cmdlen` variable is an unsigned 32-bit integer (`u32`). The function iterates `trans_pcie->max_tbs` times, summing the return values of `iwl_pcie_tfd_tb_get_len` into `cmdlen`. If the cumulative sum of these lengths exceeds the maximum value representable by a `u32` (UINT32_MAX), an integer overflow will occur. This will cause `cmdlen` to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. If this truncated length is subsequently used in memory allocation or copy operations, it could lead to a heap buffer overflow or other memory corruption."
