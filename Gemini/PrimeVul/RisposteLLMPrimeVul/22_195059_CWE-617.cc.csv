"1","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior or a system crash. This can include situations where a function returns an error code that is not properly handled, or where an assertion is used to handle a condition that should be gracefully managed.","The code uses a CHECK macro to assert that the 'input' pointer is not null after retrieving a node from 'node_map_'. If 'node_map_->GetNode' returns nullptr, indicating a potentially malformed or attacker-controlled graph input where 'node.input(0)' refers to a non-existent node, the CHECK macro will cause the program to abort. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, as an attacker can crash the application by providing crafted input. A more robust error handling mechanism, such as returning false or propagating an error, should be implemented instead of an assertion that terminates the program."

"3","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for an unusual or exceptional condition that can occur during operation, which can lead to unexpected behavior or a system crash. This can allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or other impacts.","The code uses a CHECK macro to assert that a retrieved node pointer is not null. If an attacker can provide a malformed NodeDef where node.input(0) refers to a non-existent node, node_map_->GetNode() will return nullptr. This will trigger the CHECK macro, causing the application to terminate and resulting in a denial of service. This is an improper handling of an exceptional condition."
