"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory locations.","The code performs a type cast of 'cookie' to 'source_cookie_T *' and dereferences it based solely on the comparison 'fgetline == getsourceline'. If an attacker can control 'fgetline' and 'cookie' such that 'fgetline' is 'getsourceline' but 'cookie' points to an invalid or incompatible memory region, it can lead to a type confusion vulnerability, resulting in an out-of-bounds read or arbitrary memory read, potentially causing a crash or information disclosure."
