"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the sprintf call that constructs the 'a=x-copyright' SDP line. The buf64 buffer has a fixed size of 5000 bytes. If the combined length of the fixed string prefix, the string returned by gf_gpac_version(), and the string returned by gf_gpac_copyright() exceeds 4999 characters (plus the null terminator), sprintf will write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. There are no explicit length checks or truncation mechanisms in place to prevent this."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to the use of sprintf with potentially unbounded input. Specifically, the line sprintf(buf64, ""a=x-copyright: MP4/3GP File hinted with GPAC %s - %s"", gf_gpac_version(), gf_gpac_copyright() ); writes the return values of gf_gpac_version() and gf_gpac_copyright() into the fixed-size buffer buf64 (5000 bytes). If the combined length of the format string and the returned strings exceeds the buffer's capacity, it will lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to null pointer dereferences (CWE-476) in two locations. After calling esd = gf_isom_get_esd(file, odT, 1); and esd = gf_isom_get_esd(file, sceneT, 1);, the code accesses esd->decoderConfig without checking if esd is NULL. If gf_isom_get_esd returns NULL, this will result in a crash."
