"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles the parsing of the session ticket message. It performs multiple length checks to ensure that the received message length matches the expected structure. Specifically, it checks if the total message length 'n' is at least 6 bytes (for ticket_lifetime_hint and ticklen). Crucially, it verifies that 'ticklen + 6' (where 6 accounts for the fixed-size header fields) exactly equals the total message length 'n'. This validation prevents buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads when allocating memory for 's->session->tlsext_tick' and subsequently copying data using 'memcpy' or hashing it with 'EVP_Digest'. The pointer 'p' is correctly advanced after reading header fields, ensuring 'memcpy' and 'EVP_Digest' operate on the correct portion of the buffer. Memory allocation failures are also handled."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles the parsing of a session ticket message. It performs multiple length checks to prevent buffer overflows and integer overflows. The total message length 'n' is obtained from ssl_get_message, and then the 'ticklen' (ticket length) is extracted from the message. A critical check 'if (ticklen + 6 != n)' ensures that the reported ticket length plus the fixed header length (4 bytes for lifetime hint + 2 bytes for ticklen itself) exactly matches the total received message length. This prevents both over-reads and under-reads from the input buffer 's->init_msg' when copying the ticket data using memcpy and when hashing it with EVP_Digest. Memory allocation for the ticket is based on the validated 'ticklen', and malloc failures are handled. Existing ticket data is freed before new allocation. The maximum message size is limited to 16384, which bounds the maximum value of 'ticklen' and prevents integer overflows in size calculations that could lead to heap overflows."
