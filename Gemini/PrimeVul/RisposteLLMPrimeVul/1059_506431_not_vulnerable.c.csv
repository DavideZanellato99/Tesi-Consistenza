"1","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that results in an incorrect value, which can lead to various weaknesses including buffer overflows, incorrect data processing, or denial of service.","The function `buffer_append_asn1_length` incorrectly encodes ASN.1 lengths for values greater than 0xFFFF. When `length` exceeds 0xFFFF, the function still uses a 2-byte length indicator (0x82) and truncates the actual length to its lower two bytes, leading to an encoded length that is significantly smaller than the true length. This misrepresentation can cause data integrity issues, parsing errors, or denial of service in applications processing the malformed ASN.1 data."

"4","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that results in an incorrect value. This can be due to various reasons, including incorrect formulas, incorrect order of operations, or incorrect handling of data types and ranges.","The function buffer_append_asn1_length incorrectly encodes ASN.1 lengths greater than 0xFFFF. The length parameter is an unsigned int, which can hold larger values. When length exceeds 0xFFFF, the function uses a 0x82 prefix, indicating a two-byte length, but then truncates the actual length value to two bytes. This results in a misrepresentation of the true length, potentially causing a compliant ASN.1 parser to misinterpret the data size, leading to issues like denial of service, information disclosure, or data corruption."
