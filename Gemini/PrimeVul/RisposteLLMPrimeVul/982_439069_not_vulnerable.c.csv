"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the function fails. This can result in data corruption, resource exhaustion, or other issues that are not properly handled by the application.","The return value of the WriteBlob function is explicitly ignored by casting it to void. If WriteBlob fails to write the data (e.g., due to disk full, I/O error, or invalid arguments), the heif_write_func will still return heif_error_Ok, indicating success. This can lead to silent data loss, data corruption, or an inconsistent state without the calling application being aware of the failure."
"2","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type, which can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities.","The code performs an unchecked cast of the `userdata` void pointer to an `Image*` type. If `userdata` does not point to a valid `Image` object, or an object that can be safely interpreted as an `Image` structure, subsequent operations on the `image` pointer within the `WriteBlob` function could lead to type confusion. This can result in memory corruption, crashes, or other undefined behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to achieve arbitrary memory writes or reads if they can control the `userdata` value. The return value of `WriteBlob` is also ignored, masking potential errors, but the type confusion is a more direct and severe vulnerability."
