"1","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that produces an incorrect result, which can lead to a vulnerability.","The code exhibits inconsistent logic in preparing the 'flags' value for writing. For 'field_size' values of 8 and 16, the 'flags' are shifted right by 24 and 16 bits respectively, implying an intent to extract the most significant bits. However, for any other 'field_size' value, 'flags' is used without modification, meaning the least significant bits are written. If the consistent intent is to always extract the most significant 'field_size' bits from the 32-bit 'flags', then this logic is an incorrect calculation for 'field_size' values other than 8 or 16. This can lead to writing unintended data to the bitstream, potentially causing data corruption or information disclosure if sensitive data resides in the lower bits of 'flags' when it should not be written."
"2","True","CWE-682","Function Call with Incorrect Arguments","The product calls a function with arguments that are incorrect. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or other vulnerabilities.","The function ctrn_write_sample_flags inconsistently prepares the flags argument before passing it to gf_bs_write_int. While flags is shifted right by 24 or 16 bits when field_size is 8 or 16 respectively, it is passed unshifted for all other field_size values. This logical inconsistency means that for field_size values other than 8 or 16, the full 32-bit flags value is used, which may not be the intended data to be written for a smaller field_size. This can lead to incorrect data being written to the bitstream, potentially causing data corruption, parsing errors, or information leakage if higher-order bits of flags contain sensitive information that should not be written."
