"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The memcpy copies nbytes bytes into drc_name, where nbytes can be up to MAX_DRC_NAME_LEN - 1. If the input buf does not contain a newline character and nbytes is MAX_DRC_NAME_LEN - 1, the drc_name buffer will be filled without a null terminator. Subsequently, strchr(drc_name, '\n') is called on this non-null-terminated buffer. If no newline is found within the copied nbytes, strchr will continue reading past the end of the drc_name array in search of a newline or a null terminator, leading to an out-of-bounds read."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

Although a size check prevents buffer overflow during memcpy, the drc_name buffer is not explicitly null-terminated after the copy. This allows strchr(drc_name, '\n') to potentially read beyond the allocated memory region of drc_name if no newline character is found within the copied data and the memory immediately following the buffer does not contain a null terminator or a newline, resulting in an out-of-bounds read."
