"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the function fails. This can result in resource leaks, incorrect program state, or security bypasses.","The code fails to check the return values of `seccomp_rule_add_exact` calls when configuring socket family blocklist rules. If these calls fail, the intended seccomp rules will not be applied, potentially allowing the sandboxed application to create sockets of disallowed families, leading to unintended network access or other sandbox escapes. While a comment mentions socket filtering might not work on certain architectures, the lack of explicit error checking for `seccomp_rule_add_exact` means that failures are silently ignored, resulting in an incomplete or ineffective security policy."
"2","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior or a weakened security posture.","The code fails to check the return value of seccomp_rule_add_exact when applying socket family filtering rules. The comment ""Socket filtering doesn't work on e.g. i386, so ignore failures here"" indicates that the developers were aware of potential failures but chose to ignore them. This means that if seccomp_rule_add_exact fails to apply a rule (e.g., due to an unsupported feature or architecture limitation), the intended socket family restrictions will not be enforced, but the program will continue as if they were. This can lead to a weakened sandbox where applications can create sockets with families that should have been blocked, potentially allowing unexpected network access or communication capabilities."
