"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end or before the beginning of the buffer.","The function accesses p[0] and p[1] without validating that the input pointer p points to a memory region of at least two characters. If p is a NULL pointer or points to a string/buffer with fewer than two characters, this will lead to a null pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds read, respectively, potentially causing a crash or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a location that is outside of the intended buffer's boundary.","The function does not validate if the input pointer 'p' is NULL or if it points to a buffer containing at least two characters before dereferencing 'p[0]' and 'p[1]'. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if 'p' is NULL, or an out-of-bounds read if 'p' points to a buffer smaller than two characters, potentially causing a crash or information disclosure."
