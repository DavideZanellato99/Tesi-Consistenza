"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected or undefined behavior if the function fails or returns an error condition.","The code fails to check the return values of critical OpenSSL API calls, specifically EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length and EVP_EncryptInit_ex. If these functions fail due to invalid parameters (e.g., an unsupported key length for the chosen cipher), the program will proceed with an improperly initialized cryptographic context. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or insecure encryption where data confidentiality is compromised due to cryptographic operations being performed incorrectly or not at all."

"4","True","CWE-226","Insufficiently Protected Credentials","The product stores or transmits credentials in a way that does not sufficiently protect them from unauthorized access. This can occur when credentials are stored in cleartext, or when they are encrypted but the encryption is weak or easily bypassed.","The code fails to securely erase sensitive cryptographic material, specifically the encryption key (derived from the password) and the Initialization Vector (IV), from memory after their use. If the password length is greater than or equal to the required key length, the 'key' pointer directly references the input 'password' buffer, which is never zeroed. If the password length is less than the required key length, a new 'key' buffer is allocated, populated, and then freed, but its contents are not zeroed before freeing. Similarly, the 'iv' buffer, whether it's the original input or an allocated one, is not zeroed out before being freed or left in memory. This oversight leaves sensitive cryptographic data in memory, making it susceptible to unauthorized access through memory dumps or other memory inspection techniques, potentially compromising the confidentiality of encrypted data."
