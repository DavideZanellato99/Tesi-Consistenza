"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In the section handling 'timelimit_header', the sscanf function is called with a pointer offset by url->timelimit_header_len. If url->timelimit_header_len is greater than or equal to the total size of the received header (bytes), sscanf will attempt to read from memory outside the bounds of the ptr buffer, leading to a crash or information disclosure."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds reads. In the sscanf call, (char *)ptr+url->timelimit_header_len is used as the source without validating that url->timelimit_header_len is less than the total received header length (bytes). Similarly, in the snprintf call, (char*)ptr+22 is used as the source without validating that 22 is less than the total received header length (bytes). An attacker could send a short header that matches the prefix but is shorter than the expected offset, causing the program to read past the end of the ptr buffer, leading to a crash or information disclosure."
