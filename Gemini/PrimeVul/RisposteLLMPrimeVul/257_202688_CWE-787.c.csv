"1","True","CWE-369","Divide-by-Zero","The product uses an operation that can result in a divide-by-zero error. This can occur when the divisor is obtained from external input, or when the divisor is computed in a way that does not prevent it from being zero.","The code calculates `maxY` using `lprn->BlockLine / lprn->nBh * lprn->nBh`. If `lprn->nBh` is zero, a division-by-zero error will occur, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior. This can be exploited for denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-369","Divide-by-Zero","The product divides a value by zero, which can lead to a denial of service or other problems.","The code is vulnerable to a divide-by-zero error. If lprn->nBh is zero, the calculation for maxY will result in a division by zero. Even if lprn->nBh is not zero, if lprn->BlockLine is less than lprn->nBh, integer division will make lprn->BlockLine / lprn->nBh equal to zero, causing maxY to be zero. Subsequently, the modulo operation (r + h - bh) % maxY will also result in a division by zero, leading to a program crash. Additionally, the calculation of the index for lprn->ImageBuf at (y0 + y) * bpl + bx * lprn->nBw does not properly re-wrap the y0 + y term with maxY, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read if bh is greater than 1, allowing access beyond the intended circular buffer boundary or the allocated size of ImageBuf."
