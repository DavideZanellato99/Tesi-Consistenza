"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is executed.","The code constructs an operating system command using FormatLocaleString and a format string obtained from GetDelegateCommands. One of the arguments to this command is input_filename, which is a symbolic link pointing to image_info->filename. Since image_info->filename is user-controlled, an attacker can embed shell metacharacters (e.g., "";"", ""|"", ""&"", ""`"", ""$()"", ""<"", "">"") within image_info->filename. If the format string returned by GetDelegateCommands does not properly quote or escape the input_filename argument, these metacharacters will be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution. This is a classic OS command injection vulnerability."

The format string for this command is retrieved from GetDelegateCommands(delegate_info). If this format string does not properly quote or escape the placeholders for read_info->filename and input_filename, an attacker could craft a malicious image_info->filename (which is used to derive read_info->filename and input_filename) containing shell metacharacters. These metacharacters would then be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution. Even if AcquireUniqueFilename and AcquireUniqueSymbolicLink generate unique temporary paths, if the delegate command format string is not robustly quoted (e.g., using ""%s"" instead of %s), a filename containing spaces or other shell metacharacters could lead to command injection."
