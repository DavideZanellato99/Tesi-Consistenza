"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory or other resources.","The code contains a memory leak vulnerability. In the error handling block within the for loop, if an allocation for res->ContribRow[u].Weights fails or an integer overflow is detected, the cleanup logic correctly frees previously allocated Weights arrays. However, it fails to free the res->ContribRow array itself and the main res structure, leading to a memory leak when the function returns NULL due to an error."
