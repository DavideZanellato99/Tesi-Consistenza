"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code reads 'segnum' from untrusted input and uses 'segnum - 1' as an index into the 'bin->segment_entries' array without validating if the index is within the array's bounds. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if 'segnum' is greater than the actual size of 'bin->segment_entries', potentially causing information disclosure or a denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer or before the beginning of the buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or information disclosure.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. When processing 'moveable' entry points (bundle_type == 0xff), the value of 'segnum' read from untrusted input is used as an index into the 'bin->segment_entries' array. While there is a check for 'segnum > 0', there is no check to ensure 'segnum' is less than or equal to 'bin->ne_header->SegCount', which defines the size of the 'segment_entries' array. An attacker can provide a malformed binary with an excessively large 'segnum', causing an out-of-bounds read from 'bin->segment_entries', leading to potential information disclosure or a denial of service."
