"1","True","CWE-94","Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')","The product generates code based on untrusted input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the syntax or behavior of the generated code. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or commands.","The code allows a user-defined callback function (qfl->qf_qftf_cb) to be executed if it is set. This callback is invoked via call_callback with a dictionary of application-controlled arguments. If an attacker can control the value of this callback (e.g., by setting a configuration option that defines the callback function), they can supply a malicious function. When call_qftf_func is invoked, this malicious function will be executed within the application's process, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability stems from the execution of untrusted code without sufficient validation or sandboxing mechanisms."
"2","True","CWE-94","Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')","The product generates code based on input from a separate untrusted source, but it does not sufficiently control the generation of that code, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.","The code allows a user-defined callback function, specified by qfl->qf_qftf_cb, to be executed via call_callback. If an attacker can control the qfl structure or its qf_qftf_cb member, they can supply a malicious function name or pointer. This would lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions."
