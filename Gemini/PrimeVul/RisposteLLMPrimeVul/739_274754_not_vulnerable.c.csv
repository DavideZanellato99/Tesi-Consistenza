"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The software does not release a system resource after it has finished with the resource, causing the resource to be unavailable for other programs. This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.","The code potentially leaks memory. If 'na->rl' points to an allocated runlist and 'ntfs_mapping_pairs_decompress' allocates a new runlist (as suggested by its return value being assigned to 'rl' and then 'na->rl' being updated to 'rl'), the old 'na->rl' is overwritten without being freed. This occurs when 'newrunlist' is true, indicating a new runlist was decompressed and assigned, and 'na->rl' previously held a pointer to allocated memory."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after it is no longer needed, which can lead to a gradual exhaustion of available memory or other resources.","The code potentially suffers from a memory leak. In the do-while loop, if ntfs_rl_vcn_to_lcn indicates that the VCN is not mapped, ntfs_mapping_pairs_decompress is called to decode and merge the runlist. If ntfs_mapping_pairs_decompress allocates new memory for the runlist and returns it, the previously assigned na->rl (if it was dynamically allocated and not NULL) is overwritten by na->rl = rl; without being freed. This leads to a memory leak of the old runlist data."
