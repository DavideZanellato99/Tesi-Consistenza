"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The function frees memory associated with the GroupIdToNameBox structure and its members but does not nullify the pointers after deallocation. If the function is called multiple times with the same input pointer, it will attempt to free already freed memory, leading to a double-free vulnerability and potential use-after-free issues."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code iterates through ptr->entries using ptr->nb_entries as the loop bound without first checking if ptr->entries is a non-NULL pointer. If ptr->entries is NULL and ptr->nb_entries is greater than zero, accessing ptr->entries[i] inside the loop will cause a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
