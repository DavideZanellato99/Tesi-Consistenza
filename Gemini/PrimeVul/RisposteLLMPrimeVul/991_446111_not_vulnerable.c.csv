"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code allocates a 3-byte buffer and attempts to read 3 bytes into it using atusb_control_msg. However, it only checks if the return value ret is non-negative (ret >= 0) before accessing all three bytes of the buffer (buffer[0], buffer[1], buffer[2]). If atusb_control_msg returns a value between 0 and 2 (inclusive), indicating that fewer than 3 bytes were successfully transferred, the subsequent accesses to buffer[1] or buffer[2] (or both) will read uninitialized kernel memory. This constitutes an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or unpredictable behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
