"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the loop populating input_types, the index ix (derived from edge->src_output()) is used to access node_t.args(ix). A DCHECK validates ix against node_t.args_size(), but DCHECKs are often disabled in release builds. If edge->src_output() is controlled by an attacker and exceeds node_t.args_size(), an out-of-bounds read will occur, potentially leading to information disclosure or a denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
