"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code allocates memory for a table and copies a static array auth_request_var_expand_static_tab into it. It then proceeds to write values into elements tab[0] through tab[33]. The tab pointer points to the start of the copied static array within the allocated buffer. If the size of auth_request_var_expand_static_tab (represented by auth_count) is less than 34, then writes to indices tab[auth_count] up to tab[33] will be out-of-bounds, leading to memory corruption."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code allocates memory for (*count + auth_count) elements and copies auth_count elements from auth_request_var_expand_static_tab into the latter part of the buffer. Subsequently, it accesses and writes to elements tab[0] through tab[33] relative to the start of the copied block. If auth_count (the number of elements in auth_request_var_expand_static_tab) is less than 34, then accesses like tab[auth_count], tab[auth_count+1], up to tab[33] will result in out-of-bounds writes past the end of the memcpy'd data within the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
