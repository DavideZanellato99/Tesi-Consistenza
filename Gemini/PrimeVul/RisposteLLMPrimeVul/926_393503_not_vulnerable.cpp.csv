"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or information disclosure.","The code iterates through an array using a size obtained from the array object itself. If the array's reported size (nparams) is greater than its actual allocated capacity for _values, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing aparams->_values[i], potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
