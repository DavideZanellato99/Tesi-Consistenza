"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other weaknesses.","The calculation of n_elems involves a sum of unsigned integers followed by a multiplication by 5. If this calculation results in an integer overflow, n_elems will wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. This leads to an undersized buffer allocation via arena->alloc. Subsequent attempts to write data into the ref_pointer_array, assuming the intended larger size, will result in a heap-based buffer overflow, memory corruption, and potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product uses or calculates a number that is larger than the maximum value intended to be stored in a data type, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The calculation of `n_elems` involves summing multiple unsigned integer variables and then multiplying the result by 5. If this sum or the subsequent multiplication exceeds the maximum value representable by a `uint`, an integer overflow will occur, causing `n_elems` to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. This leads to the allocation of an undersized buffer via `arena->alloc`. Subsequent attempts to write data into this buffer, through `ref_pointer_array`, will result in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
