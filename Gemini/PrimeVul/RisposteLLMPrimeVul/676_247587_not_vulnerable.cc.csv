"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a C++ test case that configures TLS contexts for a client and a server. It specifies TLS protocol versions, cipher suites, and uses self-signed certificates and keys, which is standard practice for testing environments. The code itself does not contain any direct security vulnerabilities such as input validation issues, memory safety flaws, or improper cryptographic implementations. It is merely setting up test parameters for an SSL socket test."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a C++ test case for an SSL socket. It configures client and server TLS contexts with modern protocols (TLSv1.2), strong cipher suites (ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256), and uses certificate hash verification (pinning) on the client side. The server is configured with multiple certificate/key pairs, which is a valid setup. This code is part of a test suite and does not expose any direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, insecure data handling, or misconfigurations that would lead to a weakness in a production system. The configurations chosen are generally considered secure practices for TLS."
