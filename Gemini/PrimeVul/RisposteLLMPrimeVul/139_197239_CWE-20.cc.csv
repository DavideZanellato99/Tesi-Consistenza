"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product performs a division operation where the divisor is not checked to prevent a zero value, which could lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code calculates a 'scales' vector where each element involves a division by 'requested_min_max'. The 'requested_min_max' variable is derived from 'input_requested_min_float' and 'input_requested_max_float' using std::max(std::abs(...), std::abs(...)). If both 'input_requested_min_float' and 'input_requested_max_float' are zero, 'requested_min_max' will be zero, leading to a division by zero error. This can result in floating-point exceptions, NaN/INF propagation, and potentially lead to crashes or undefined behavior when these values are passed to the MKL-DNN library."

"3","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code calculates requested_min_max as the maximum of the absolute values of input_requested_min_float and input_requested_max_float. If both input_requested_min_float and input_requested_max_float are zero, then requested_min_max will be zero. This zero value is then used as a divisor in the calculation of scales[i], specifically in the term min_max_from_vec / requested_min_max. This will result in a floating-point division by zero, leading to INF or NaN values in the scales vector, which can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect results when passed to the MKL-DNN set_output_scales function."
