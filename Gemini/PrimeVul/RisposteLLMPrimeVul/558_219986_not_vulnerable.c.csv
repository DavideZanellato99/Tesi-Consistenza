"1","True","CWE-863","Incorrect Authorization","The product does not perform an authorization check when it should, or it performs an authorization check using an incorrect algorithm or with insufficient privileges.","The code snippet retrieves a list of plugins for a user but explicitly marks the 'request' parameter as unused. This indicates a potential lack of authorization checks based on the incoming request, which could allow unauthorized access to the plugin list, leading to information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically causes a program crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The code retrieves a JSON object and attempts to extract the 'module' field using json_object_get. The result of json_object_get is directly passed to ulfius_set_json_body_response without checking if json_object_get returned a valid pointer. If the 'module' key does not exist in the j_plugin_list JSON object, json_object_get will return NULL. Passing this NULL pointer to ulfius_set_json_body_response could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a crash (Denial of Service) or other undefined behavior."
