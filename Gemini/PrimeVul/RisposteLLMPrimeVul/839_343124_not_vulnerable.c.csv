"1","True","CWE-823","Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset","The product uses a pointer offset that is outside the intended bounds of a buffer, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read or write. This can occur when an attacker can control the offset value, or when the offset is calculated incorrectly.","The code performs pointer arithmetic by adding `seqhilen` to the `tmp` pointer. If `seqhilen` is an attacker-controlled value and is not properly validated against the size of the buffer pointed to by `tmp`, this operation can result in an out-of-bounds pointer. Subsequent dereferencing of this pointer by the caller could lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, allowing an attacker to access memory outside the intended buffer."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location, often resulting in a crash or denial of service.","The function does not validate the `aead` parameter. If `aead` is a NULL pointer, dereferencing it via `crypto_aead_ivsize(aead)` or `crypto_aead_alignmask(aead)` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a system crash or denial of service."
