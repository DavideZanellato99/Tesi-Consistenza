"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be exploited to consume excessive resources and cause a denial of service.","The code allocates a fixed-size buffer for ZSTD decompression. While the ZSTD library functions are designed to respect the provided buffer size, there is no mechanism in this snippet to limit the total amount of data that can be decompressed and subsequently passed to the Curl_unencode_write function. An attacker could provide a small, highly compressed input stream (a 'decompression bomb') that expands to an extremely large amount of data. This could lead to a denial of service by exhausting system memory or disk space when Curl_unencode_write attempts to process and store the excessively large decompressed output."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The software allocates memory during program execution, but it does not free the memory after it has finished with it. This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory, which can eventually cause the program or system to crash.","The code allocates memory for zp->decomp using malloc if it's not already allocated. However, there is no corresponding free call for zp->decomp within this function or an immediately apparent mechanism for its release in the provided snippet. This can lead to a memory leak over time, potentially causing resource exhaustion and denial of service if the function is called repeatedly without proper cleanup of the zstd_params structure."
