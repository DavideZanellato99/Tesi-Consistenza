"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been initialized or has been set to NULL, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.","The code dereferences chunk->skb and chunk->transport without checking if these pointers are NULL. If chunk->skb is NULL, the macro SCTP_INPUT_CB will likely attempt to dereference a NULL pointer. Similarly, if chunk->transport is NULL, accessing chunk->transport->encap_port will result in a NULL pointer dereference. Both scenarios can lead to a system crash or denial of service."
