"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences the 'c' pointer via 'c->mt' without first checking if 'c' is a NULL pointer. If 'c' is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to undefined behavior and likely a program crash."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been initialized or has been set to NULL, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.","The MRB_CLASS_ORIGIN(c) macro, depending on its implementation, might modify the c pointer. If c initially points to a valid RClass object that is a singleton class (MRB_TT_SCLASS) and its super field is NULL, the macro could assign NULL to c. Subsequently, the line h = c->mt; will attempt to dereference the now-NULL c pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference."
