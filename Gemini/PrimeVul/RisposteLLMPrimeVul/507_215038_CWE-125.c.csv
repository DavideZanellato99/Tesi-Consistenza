"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two or more numbers is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in the data type intended to hold the result, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows.","The code calculates `flxdec->size` by multiplying `flxh->width` and `flxh->height`. If these values, read from an untrusted input header, are sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum value for `guint`, leading to an integer overflow. This results in `flxdec->size` being a smaller-than-expected value. Consequently, `g_malloc` calls for `flxdec->frame_data` and `flxdec->delta_data` will allocate undersized buffers. Later, the `flx_decode_chunks` function attempts to write the actual frame data into `flxdec->frame_data`. If the actual frame data size (derived from the original, large width and height) is greater than the undersized allocated buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two or more numbers is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the data type intended to hold the result, leading to an incorrect, typically smaller, value. This can often lead to subsequent buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues when the undersized result is used for memory allocation or indexing.","The code calculates `flxdec->size = ((guint) flxh->width * (guint) flxh->height);` using width and height values from an untrusted input file header. If `flxh->width` and `flxh->height` are sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum value of `guint`, leading to an integer overflow. This results in `flxdec->size` holding a smaller-than-expected value. Subsequently, `g_malloc` is called with this truncated size to allocate `flxdec->frame_data` and `flxdec->delta_data`. Later operations, such as `flx_decode_chunks` writing to `flxdec->frame_data` or `memcpy` writing to `flxdec->delta_data`, will attempt to write data based on the original, larger dimensions into these undersized buffers, causing a heap buffer overflow."
