"1","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to resource exhaustion.","The code does not check the return values of the shutdown() and close() system calls. If these calls fail, the socket descriptors might not be properly released by the operating system, leading to a file descriptor leak. Repeated failures could exhaust available file descriptors, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application."

"5","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished with the resource's effective lifetime, which can lead to resource exhaustion.","The code does not check the return values of the shutdown and close system calls. If close fails, the underlying socket resource might not be properly released by the operating system, potentially leading to resource exhaustion over time in a long-running service. Although the socket descriptor in the ctrl structure is set to -1, preventing a double close from the application's perspective, the OS resource might still be active."
