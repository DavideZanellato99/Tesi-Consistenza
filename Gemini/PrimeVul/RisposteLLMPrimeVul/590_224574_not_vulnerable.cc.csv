"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a TensorFlow shape inference function. It correctly uses TensorFlow's shape inference utilities (e.g., c->WithRank, c->Merge, c->Dim) and the TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR macro to handle potential errors and inconsistencies in input shapes and attributes. Input validation for 'data_format_str' is present, and the logic for determining ranks and merging dimensions appears sound. There are no direct memory manipulations, unchecked buffer accesses, integer overflows, or other common C/C++ vulnerabilities evident in this snippet. The code relies on the robustness of the underlying TensorFlow API, which is assumed to be secure."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet performs shape inference for a FusedBatchNormGrad operation. It robustly handles input validation by checking data format, input ranks, and merging dimensions. The extensive use of TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR ensures that any invalid input or shape mismatch results in an error status being returned, preventing crashes or memory corruption. There are no apparent buffer overflows, integer overflows, or out-of-bounds accesses that would lead to security vulnerabilities."
