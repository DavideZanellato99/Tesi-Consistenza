"1","True","CWE-119","Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer","The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.","The function performs pixel data conversion without validating the size of the input `src` and output `dest` buffers, nor the relationship between the `bytes` parameter and the number of components being read per pixel (3 or 4). If the `bytes` parameter, which represents the stride between pixels in the source buffer, is less than the number of components being accessed (e.g., `bytes < 3` when `alpha` is false, or `bytes < 4` when `alpha` is true), an out-of-bounds read will occur on the `src` buffer. Additionally, if the total allocated size for `src` or `dest` is insufficient to accommodate `width` pixels, the function will read or write past the end of these buffers, leading to buffer over-read or over-write vulnerabilities. This lack of bounds checking can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function bgr2rgb lacks proper validation for the 'width' and 'bytes' parameters, which are used to determine memory access patterns for the 'src' and 'dest' buffers. Without checks to ensure that 'width' and 'bytes' do not cause accesses beyond the allocated buffer boundaries, an attacker can provide crafted values leading to an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) to the 'dest' buffer and out-of-bounds reads from the 'src' buffer. This can result in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
