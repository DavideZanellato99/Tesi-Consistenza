"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet is a unit test designed to verify the correct behavior of a QUIC server when it receives a StopSendingFrame for a stream that has already been reset. The test explicitly expects that the onStopSending callback will not be invoked, which indicates that the underlying implementation correctly handles frames for closed or reset streams by ignoring them or processing them without causing state inconsistencies or unexpected actions. This demonstrates robust error handling rather than a vulnerability."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a unit test designed to verify the correct handling of a StopSendingFrame received after a stream has already been reset. The test setup itself does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. It demonstrates a robust handling mechanism where the onStopSending callback is not expected to be triggered for an already reset stream, which is a secure design choice to prevent issues like use-after-free or unexpected state transitions. The code is testing for the absence of a vulnerability in the QUIC server's stream management."
