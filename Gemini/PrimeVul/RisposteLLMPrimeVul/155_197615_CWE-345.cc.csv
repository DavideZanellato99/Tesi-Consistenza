"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code allocates a new tensorflow::Tensor based on a shape read from an external checkpoint file. If an attacker can provide a malicious checkpoint file with an excessively large tensor shape, it can lead to an extremely large memory allocation. This can exhaust system memory, causing an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error and resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application or the system."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are requested or consumed. This can be used to consume too many resources, which can reduce system performance or lead to a denial of service.","The code reads tensor shape information from an untrusted checkpoint file and uses it directly to allocate memory for a new tensor. An attacker can provide an excessively large shape, leading to an attempt to allocate a huge amount of memory, which can exhaust system resources and cause a Denial of Service. Additionally, if the internal size calculation for the tensor allocation or the subsequent data copying operation is vulnerable to integer overflows or incorrect size validation, it could lead to an undersized buffer allocation and a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow when data is copied from the untrusted file."
