"1","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index","The product uses an array, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates the index into the array, which can result in reading or writing outside of the intended bounds of the array.","The code uses reg->optimize as an index into the static 'on' array without any bounds checking. The 'on' array has 6 elements (indices 0-5). If reg->optimize holds a value outside this valid range, it will result in an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a crash (denial of service) or potentially information disclosure if the memory at the invalid index contains sensitive data. This value is likely derived from user-supplied regular expression patterns, making it a potential attack vector."
