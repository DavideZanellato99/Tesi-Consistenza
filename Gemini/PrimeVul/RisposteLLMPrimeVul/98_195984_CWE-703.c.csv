"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, causing a buffer overflow.","The code reads bytes from a bitstream into a fixed-size buffer `str` (1024 bytes) within a loop. There is no bounds checking on the index `i` before writing to `str[i]`. If the input bitstream contains more than 1023 non-null bytes before a null terminator, the loop will write past the end of the `str` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without sufficiently verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the destination buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code reads bytes from a bitstream into a fixed-size stack-allocated buffer (str[1024]) within a while loop. There is no bounds checking on the index 'i' before writing to str[i]. If the input from the bitstream does not contain a null terminator within 1023 characters, the loop will continue to write past the end of the 'str' buffer, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow."
