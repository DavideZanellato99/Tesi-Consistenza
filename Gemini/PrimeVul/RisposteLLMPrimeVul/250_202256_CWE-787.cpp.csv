"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which might be controlled by an actor. This can lead to a denial of service.","The code allocates a StrokeHandler object with a size dependent on path.elementCount(). If an attacker can provide a QVectorPath with an extremely large number of elements, this could lead to an attempt to allocate a very large amount of memory. This uncontrolled memory allocation could exhaust system resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) for the application or the entire system."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, corrupt data, or information disclosure.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. When processing a QPainterPath::CurveToElement, the 'types' pointer, which iterates over the path's element types, is incorrectly incremented by 3 ('types += 3') instead of 1. Since QPainterPath::CurveToElement represents a single element type, incrementing by 3 causes the 'types' pointer to read past the allocated memory for the path's element types array. This out-of-bounds read can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially result in information disclosure."
