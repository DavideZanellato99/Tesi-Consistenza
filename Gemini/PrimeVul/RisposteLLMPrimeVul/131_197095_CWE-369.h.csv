"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs pointer arithmetic on input and output data buffers using dimensions derived from `params.broadcast_shape` without any bounds checking. Maliciously crafted `params.broadcast_shape` values could lead to out-of-bounds reads from input buffers or out-of-bounds writes to the output buffer, potentially causing data corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs pointer arithmetic on input1_data_ptr, input2_data_ptr, and output_data_ptr based on dimensions (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4) derived from params.broadcast_shape. There are no explicit bounds checks within this function to ensure that these pointer increments do not exceed the allocated memory for the input and output buffers. If an attacker can control or influence the values in params.broadcast_shape, they could provide dimensions that cause the pointers to read or write beyond the boundaries of the provided buffers, leading to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) or out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) vulnerabilities. This can result in data corruption, denial of service (crashes), or potentially arbitrary code execution."
