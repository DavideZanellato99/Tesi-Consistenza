"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit.","The function vrend_renderer_blit takes a const struct pipe_blit_info *info as an argument but does not perform a null check on this pointer before dereferencing it. Multiple accesses to members of info, such as info->render_condition_enable, info->src.format, and info->dst.box.width, occur without validating that info is not NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed for info, the program will attempt to dereference a null address, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service."
