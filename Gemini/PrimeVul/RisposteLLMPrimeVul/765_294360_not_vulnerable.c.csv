"1","True","CWE-835","Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')","The program contains a loop that does not terminate or does not terminate in a timely manner, which can lead to a denial of service or resource exhaustion. This occurs when the loop's exit condition is never met or is dependent on external factors that may not occur.","The code contains an infinite loop if the 'step' argument is zero. The condition 'else if (c == 0)' checks if 'step' is zero, and if true, enters a 'while (1)' loop that continuously yields the same 'date' value without any exit condition. This can lead to a denial of service by consuming CPU resources indefinitely."
