"1","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to resource exhaustion or other problems.","The code calls usb_get_dev to increment the reference count for the USB device. If subsequent operations like hid_parse or hid_hw_start fail, the error handling path at err_free calls kfree(priv) but fails to call usb_put_dev(priv->usbdev) to decrement the reference count. This results in a resource leak, as the USB device's reference count remains elevated, preventing its proper cleanup."
"2","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to resource exhaustion or other problems. This can apply to memory, file handles, network connections, or other system resources.","The code increments the reference count of the usb_device object via usb_get_dev(udev) and stores it in priv->usbdev. However, in the error handling path (err_free), only kfree(priv) is called. The corresponding usb_put_dev(priv->usbdev) call is missing. This results in a resource leak where the reference count of the usb_device remains incremented, preventing its proper release if an error occurs after usb_get_dev but before the function successfully returns."
