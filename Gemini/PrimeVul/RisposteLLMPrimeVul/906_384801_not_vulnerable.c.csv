"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The function vim_iswordc_buf takes a pointer buf_T *buf but does not check if buf is NULL before dereferencing it via GET_CHARTAB(buf, c) or passing it to utf_class_buf(c, buf). If a NULL pointer is provided for buf, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The function uses GET_CHARTAB(buf, c) where c can range from 1 to 255. If GET_CHARTAB is implemented as an array access (e.g., buf->chartab[c]) and the underlying array is not sufficiently sized (i.e., less than 256 elements), an out-of-bounds read will occur when c is an index beyond the array's bounds. This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
