"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C/C++ code snippet implements the Array.prototype.splice method. The code includes robust input validation and bounds checking for 'start' and 'delete' parameters, ensuring they remain within valid array indices. It also checks for potential length overflows before modifying the array by comparing the new length against NJS_MAX_LENGTH. Memory allocation and reallocation (via njs_array_alloc and njs_array_expand) are checked for success. The copying of elements, both for deleted items and new items, appears to be handled correctly. The use of memcpy in the fast path for copying new items from 'args' to 'array->start' is safe because 'args' (function arguments) and 'array->start' (internal array buffer) are expected to be distinct memory regions, preventing source/destination overlap issues. The slow path uses VM-specific property accessors (njs_value_property_i64_set, njs_value_property_i64_delete) which are assumed to handle their own internal safety. Assuming the helper functions (like njs_array_expand, njs_array_copy_within, and VM property accessors) are correctly implemented, this snippet does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free."
