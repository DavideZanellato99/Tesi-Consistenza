"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses the 'parno' variable as an index to write into the 'had_endbrace' array (had_endbrace[parno] = TRUE;). While 'parno' is constrained by 'NSUBEXP' (via checks on 'regnpar' and 'regnzpar') to be within the range [0, NSUBEXP-1], there is no explicit check within this code snippet to ensure that the 'had_endbrace' array is actually allocated with a size of at least 'NSUBEXP'. If 'had_endbrace' is defined with a size smaller than 'NSUBEXP', an attacker could craft input that causes 'parno' to exceed the actual bounds of the 'had_endbrace' array, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This vulnerability can result in memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses 'parno' as an index into the 'had_endbrace' array. The 'parno' variable is assigned the current value of 'regnpar' (or 'regnzpar') before it is incremented, and 'regnpar' is checked against 'NSUBEXP' to prevent exceeding the maximum number of subexpressions. This logic ensures that 'parno' can take any integer value from 0 up to NSUBEXP-1. If the 'had_endbrace' array is declared with a size less than 'NSUBEXP', then writing to 'had_endbrace[parno]' when 'parno' is at its maximum value (NSUBEXP-1) would result in an out-of-bounds write. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and the overwritten data."
