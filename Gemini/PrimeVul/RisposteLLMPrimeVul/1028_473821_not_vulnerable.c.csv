"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str accepts an array items[] as an argument without a corresponding size parameter. The variable 'n' is used as an index to write into this array. In multiple code paths, 'n' is incremented based on values retrieved from internal lookup tables (e.g., to->n, z3->n, z2->n). If these lookup table entries contain sufficiently large values, the function will write beyond the allocated bounds of the 'items' array provided by the caller, resulting in an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (buffer overflow). An attacker could potentially craft input to trigger lookups that lead to a large number of items being written, causing memory corruption."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function onigenc_unicode_get_case_fold_codes_by_str writes into the provided items[] array without performing any bounds checking. The counter 'n' is incremented for each item added, and if the number of generated case-fold codes exceeds the size of the buffer allocated by the caller, an out-of-bounds write will occur. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
