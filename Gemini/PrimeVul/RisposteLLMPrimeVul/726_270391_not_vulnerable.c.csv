"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a boolean logic check that safely accesses members of the 'inflater' struct after performing a NULL pointer check. It does not perform any operations that introduce direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free issues. The logic is sound for its intended purpose of determining if an inflater needs more input."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly checks for a NULL inflater pointer before dereferencing it, preventing a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. It performs logical comparisons and does not involve operations like memory allocation, deallocation, string manipulation, or arithmetic on untrusted input that commonly lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string issues. The function is a pure boolean logic function that defensively checks the state of the inflater object."
