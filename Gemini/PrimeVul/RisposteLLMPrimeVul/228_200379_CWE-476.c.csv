"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code iterates through bin->ne_header->SegCount to access bin->segment_entries[i]. If SegCount is controlled by an untrusted input (e.g., from a malformed file header) and is larger than the actual allocated size of bin->segment_entries, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing bin->segment_entries[i]. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and subsequent use of the read data."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates using `bin->ne_header->SegCount` which is read from an untrusted NE binary header. If an attacker provides a malicious NE file where `SegCount` is larger than the actual allocated size of `bin->segment_entries`, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing `bin->segment_entries[i]`. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
