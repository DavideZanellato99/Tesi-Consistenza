"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid memory address (NULL). This typically causes a program crash or denial of service.","The function `IsConstantFoldable` takes a `const Node* n` as an argument. The code immediately dereferences `n` multiple times, such as in `n->IsConstant()` and `n->op_def()`, without first checking if `n` is a null pointer. If a null pointer is passed for `n`, these dereferences will result in a segmentation fault or an access violation, leading to a program crash and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two or more numbers is calculated, and the result is stored in a data type that is too small to hold the result, leading to an integer overflow or wraparound. This can cause unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or denial of service.","The calculation of the total tensor size using `out_shape.num_elements() * DataTypeSize(n->output_type(i))` can lead to a signed integer overflow. If the product of these two values exceeds the maximum value representable by `int64_t`, the result will wrap around to a smaller or negative value due to undefined behavior. This can cause the subsequent size check `> max_constant_size_in_bytes` to incorrectly evaluate to false, allowing an oversized constant to be considered foldable. This bypass of the size limit could lead to excessive memory allocation, resource exhaustion, or denial of service when the constant is materialized."
