"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a test case designed to verify that a TLS connection fails when the client certificate's CA is not trusted by the server, even if a specific certificate hash is also configured for verification. It explicitly sets up a scenario where the server's trusted CA is different from the client certificate's issuer, and then asserts that the connection fails with the expected verification error (X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY). This demonstrates the correct security behavior of rejecting an untrusted certificate, rather than being a vulnerability itself."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a unit test designed to verify that a TLS connection fails as expected when a client presents a certificate issued by an untrusted Certificate Authority, even if a specific certificate hash is configured for verification. The test asserts that the system correctly rejects the connection with the expected error code (X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY), indicating proper enforcement of certificate trust policies. This is a test of a security feature, not a vulnerability in the test code itself."
