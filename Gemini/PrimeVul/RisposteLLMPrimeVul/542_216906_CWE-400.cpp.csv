"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The `drop_table` function directly uses the `name` parameter in the `maria_delete_table_files` call without apparent sanitization or validation. If `name` can be controlled by an untrusted source, an attacker could supply a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) to delete arbitrary files on the system, leading to denial of service or data loss."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory. This can allow an attacker to access or manipulate files in unintended locations.","The drop_table function directly passes the 'name' parameter, which is a const char*, to the maria_delete_table_files function. If 'name' originates from untrusted input and is not properly sanitized or validated to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., '../'), an attacker could supply a malicious path. This would allow the maria_delete_table_files function to delete arbitrary files outside the intended directory, leading to denial of service or data loss. The provided code snippet does not include any explicit sanitization or validation of the 'name' parameter before its use in a file system operation."
