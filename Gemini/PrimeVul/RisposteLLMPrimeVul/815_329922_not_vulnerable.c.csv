"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two or more numbers is greater than the maximum value for the data type used to store the result, leading to an incorrect value. This can cause unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The code calculates a stride 'i' based on 'info->extents.width'. If 'format' is PIXMAN_a8r8g8b8, 'i' is set to 'info->extents.width * 4'. If 'info->extents.width' is sufficiently large, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, causing 'i' to wrap around to a small or zero value. Consequently, the condition 'i * info->extents.height > (int) sizeof (buf)' might evaluate to false, leading the code to use the small stack-allocated buffer 'buf' (2048 bytes) for the 'mask' image, with the overflowed 'i' as the stride. When 'pixman_image_create_bits' is called with the large 'info->extents.width' and 'info->extents.height' but a small 'buf' and an overflowed stride, subsequent calls to 'pixman_image_composite32' attempting to draw into this 'mask' will write beyond the bounds of 'buf', resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow."
