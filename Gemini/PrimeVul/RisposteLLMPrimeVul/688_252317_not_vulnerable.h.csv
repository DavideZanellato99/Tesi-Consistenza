"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The program performs a buffer access that writes to a location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer, which can corrupt data, lead to a crash, or allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code calculates the total size required for channel data within `tmpBuffer` by iteratively advancing `tmpBufferEnd` based on `data_width`, `num_lines`, and `pixelSize` for each channel. There is no check to ensure that the cumulative size for all channels does not exceed the allocated `tmpBufSize` for `tmpBuffer`. If the sum of `channelData[i].nx * channelData[i].ny * channelData[i].size` for all channels is greater than `tmpBufSize`, then `tmpBufferEnd` will point beyond the allocated memory of `tmpBuffer`.
