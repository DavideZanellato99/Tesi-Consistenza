"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, which might cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs or to the product itself.","The code allocates memory for a duplicate of the keyid string using g_strdup, which is then added to a GPtrArray. However, the GPtrArray is initialized with g_ptr_array_new, meaning it does not have a custom free function set to release the memory of its elements when the array itself is freed. This results in a memory leak for each keyid string added to the array, as the memory allocated by g_strdup will not be automatically freed when the GPtrArray is destroyed."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product accesses or dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which is NULL, which can cause a crash or other undefined behavior.","The function dereferences the `gpg` pointer multiple times (e.g., `gpg->mode`, `gpg->recipients`) without first checking if `gpg` is a NULL pointer. If `gpg` is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing the program to crash or exhibit undefined behavior."
