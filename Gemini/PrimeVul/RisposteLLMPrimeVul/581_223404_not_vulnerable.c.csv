"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In the switch statement, specifically for opcodes like OP_MARK, OP_COMMIT_ARG, OP_PRUNE_ARG, and OP_THEN_ARG, the instruction pointer 'cc' is advanced by '1 + 2 + cc[1]'. If an attacker can control the bytecode stream, they can provide a malicious value for 'cc[1]' that causes 'cc' to jump beyond the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read when 'cc' is subsequently dereferenced in the loop condition or switch statement. This can result in a denial of service (crash) or information leakage."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs an out-of-bounds read when processing opcodes like OP_MARK, OP_COMMIT_ARG, OP_PRUNE_ARG, or OP_THEN_ARG. If the pointer 'cc' points to the last byte of the valid opcode sequence (i.e., 'cc' is 'ccend - 1'), the expression 'cc[1]' attempts to read a byte beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash, information disclosure, or unpredictable program behavior."
