"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Memory for 'skey' is allocated based on 'size' from an incoming message. However, 'skey->keylen' is read from the message data itself and used in a subsequent 'memcpy' operation into 'skey->key'. If an attacker provides a 'skey->keylen' value larger than the actual buffer space available for 'skey->key' within the 'size'-allocated memory, a buffer overflow will occur. The size validation check 'size != tipc_aead_key_size(skey)' happens after the 'memcpy', meaning the overflow has already occurred before the check can prevent it."
