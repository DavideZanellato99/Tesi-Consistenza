"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The code passes `argv[0]`, a user-supplied string argument, directly to `peer_flag_unset_vty`. If `peer_flag_unset_vty` copies this string into a fixed-size buffer without proper length validation, a buffer overflow could occur. An attacker could provide an excessively long string for `argv[0]` to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that input. This can lead to a variety of issues, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.","The code passes argv[0], which is user-controlled input representing a neighbor address, directly to the peer_flag_unset_vty function without any explicit validation or sanitization within this snippet. If peer_flag_unset_vty does not adequately validate the format, length, or content of argv[0], an attacker could provide malformed or excessively long input. This could lead to various issues such as buffer overflows, denial of service, or incorrect state manipulation, depending on the internal implementation of peer_flag_unset_vty."
