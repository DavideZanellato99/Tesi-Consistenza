"1","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that produces an incorrect result, which can lead to a variety of other weaknesses.","The function kssl_keytab_is_available incorrectly reports that a keytab is available when krb5_kt_get_entry returns KRB5_KT_NOTFOUND. This means if the keytab file exists but does not contain an entry for the specified principal, the function returns true (1), misleading the caller into believing the keytab is usable for that principal when it is not."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit condition, introducing a denial of service.","The code does not check the return value of krb5_sname_to_principal. If this function fails, the princ variable might be NULL. Subsequently, krb5_kt_get_entry is called with this potentially NULL princ pointer, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and an application crash, resulting in a denial of service."
