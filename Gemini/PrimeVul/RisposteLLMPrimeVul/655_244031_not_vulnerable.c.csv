"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The software does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected or erroneous behavior if the function fails.","The code does not check the return value of gf_list_new(). If gf_list_new() fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, the tmp->tags member will be assigned NULL. Subsequent attempts to use tmp->tags without a null check by the caller could lead to a null pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, often resulting in a crash or denial of service.","The code snippet is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. If the ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC macro fails to allocate memory for 'tmp' (e.g., due to memory exhaustion) and returns a NULL pointer, the subsequent access 'tmp->tags = gf_list_new();' will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash or denial of service. There is no check for 'tmp' being NULL after the allocation macro and before its use."
