"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.","The code accesses `shape_replacement_map` using the `.at(n)` method. If the `Node* n` key is not present in `shape_replacement_map`, the `.at()` method will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception. If this exception is not caught, it will lead to program termination, resulting in a Denial of Service. An attacker who can control the value of `n` could exploit this to crash the application. Additionally, the `CHECK` macros will terminate the program if their conditions are not met, which could also be triggered by malformed input, leading to further Denial of Service vulnerabilities."

"5","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle exceptional conditions, which can lead to a variety of weaknesses including denial of service, information exposure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses `shape_replacement_map.at(n)` without verifying if `n` exists as a key. If `n` is not found, an `std::out_of_range` exception will be thrown. If this exception is not caught, it will lead to program termination, causing a Denial of Service. Additionally, the `CHECK` macros will abort the program if underlying operations fail, which could also be triggered by malformed input, leading to Denial of Service."
