"1","True","CWE-789","Uncontrolled Allocation of Memory in a Loop","The software allocates memory in a loop, but it does not properly control the amount of memory that is allocated, which can lead to excessive memory consumption or denial of service.","The code contains a logical error in the second loop that processes 'element->symbols'. After successfully converting a symbol and appending it to the result list 'res', the physical address ('paddr') of the symbol is not inserted into the hash table 'hash'. This omission means that if 'element->symbols' contains multiple entries with the same 'paddr', all of them will be added to 'res' as duplicates, as the hash table will not correctly identify them as already processed. This can lead to the 'res' list growing excessively large, consuming significant memory, and potentially causing a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be exploited to consume an excessive amount of resources and potentially lead to a denial of service.","The code attempts to prevent duplicate symbols from being added to the result list by using a hash table to track physical addresses of already processed symbols. However, in the second loop, which processes element->symbols, if a new symbol is successfully created and appended to the result list, its physical address is not inserted into the hash table. This omission means that symbols from element->symbols that are duplicates of other symbols can be repeatedly added to the result list. An attacker could craft a malicious binary with a large number of duplicate symbols, leading to excessive memory allocation and potentially a denial of service due to uncontrolled resource consumption."
