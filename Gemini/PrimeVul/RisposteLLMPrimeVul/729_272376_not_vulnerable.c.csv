"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can cause a crash or other undesirable behavior, or may be used to read sensitive information from other memory locations.","The code uses cms->selected_digest as an index into the digest_params array without any bounds checking. If cms->selected_digest contains a value that is outside the valid index range of digest_params, an out-of-bounds read will occur. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses cms->selected_digest as an index into the digest_params array without any bounds checking. If cms->selected_digest can be controlled by an attacker or can otherwise hold a value outside the valid index range of digest_params, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service (crash), or other undefined behavior."
