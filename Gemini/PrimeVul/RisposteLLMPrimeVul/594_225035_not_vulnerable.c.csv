"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code does not check if the PGconn pointer returned by PQconnectStart(conninfo) is NULL before passing it to internal_ping(conn). If PQconnectStart fails (e.g., due to memory allocation issues or invalid connection information), conn will be NULL.

"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has been initialized to NULL, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The PQconnectStart function can return a NULL pointer if connection initialization fails (e.g., due to invalid conninfo or memory allocation issues). The code does not check if the returned conn pointer is NULL before passing it to internal_ping and PQfinish.
