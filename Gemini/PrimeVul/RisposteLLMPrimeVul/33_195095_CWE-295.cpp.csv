"1","True","CWE-295","Improper Certificate Validation","The product does not properly validate a certificate, which can allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.","The code initializes an SSL/TLS client connection but lacks explicit hostname verification against the server's presented certificate. While Server Name Indication (SNI) is enabled, OpenSSL does not automatically perform hostname validation by default. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to present a valid certificate for a different domain, leading to a successful connection without the client detecting the hostname mismatch."
"2","True","CWE-295","Improper Certificate Validation","The product does not properly validate a certificate, which can allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.","The code fails to perform proper hostname verification against the server's certificate. While Server Name Indication (SNI) is set, OpenSSL's default certificate validation only checks the chain of trust and expiration, not whether the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) matches the connected hostname. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker with a valid certificate for a different domain to successfully intercept and decrypt traffic."
