"1","True","CWE-704","Improper Type Conversion","The software converts data from one type to another, but the conversion is not performed correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities such as crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code calls NCURSES_PUTP2 with a string literal and the variable orig_pair. While orig_pair is typically an integer in the context of color pairs, its type is not explicitly defined in the snippet. If orig_pair is an integer and the NCURSES_PUTP2 macro expands to a function or macro that expects a character pointer (char*) for its second argument, an implicit and improper type conversion from integer to char* would occur. This type confusion could lead to a segmentation fault, resulting in a Denial of Service, or an out-of-bounds read if the resulting invalid pointer is dereferenced by the underlying function."
