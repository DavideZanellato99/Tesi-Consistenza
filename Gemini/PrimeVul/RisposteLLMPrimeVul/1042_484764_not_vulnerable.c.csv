"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and then attempts to dereference it. This typically causes the application to crash or terminate.","The code attempts to extract a device ID using strrchr(queue->info->xbdev->nodename, '/') + 1. If the nodename string does not contain a '/' character, strrchr will return NULL. Adding 1 to a NULL pointer and then using the resulting invalid pointer (devid) in snprintf will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a kernel panic."
