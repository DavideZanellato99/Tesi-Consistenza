"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, which can cause a buffer overflow.","The function performs multiple memcpy operations to copy data into the dest_strip buffer. The total amount of data copied, calculated as left_width + (num_tiles * src_width) + right_width bytes, is not checked against the allocated size of dest_strip. If this total size exceeds the capacity of dest_strip, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to data corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. Furthermore, the memcpy operations read from src_strip using parameters like left_offset, left_width, src_width, and right_width without validating if these parameters cause reads beyond the allocated bounds of src_strip, which could lead to out-of-bounds reads."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of the intended buffer.","The function performs multiple memcpy operations without validating that the destination buffer (dest_strip) is large enough to accommodate the total data being copied based on left_width, num_tiles * src_width, and right_width. An attacker controlling these size parameters could cause an out-of-bounds write on dest_strip, leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution. Additionally, out-of-bounds reads from src_strip are possible if left_offset or the widths exceed its bounds."
