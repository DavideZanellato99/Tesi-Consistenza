"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program does not release a block of memory after it is no longer needed, leading to a memory leak.","The function allocates memory for 'new_path' using 'strdup(cookie_path)'. If 'new_path[0]' is not '/', the function calls 'strstore(&new_path, ""/"")'. The 'strstore' function is not defined in the provided snippet. If 'strstore' is implemented such that it attempts to allocate new memory for the string ""/"" but fails (e.g., due to an internal 'strdup' call returning NULL) and does not free the original 'new_path' before returning, then the memory allocated by the initial 'strdup(cookie_path)' will be leaked. This constitutes a memory leak vulnerability."

"3","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime, which might cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs or to the product itself.","The code snippet calls a custom function `strstore` to reassign the `new_path` pointer. If `strstore` does not free the memory pointed to by `new_path` (which was allocated by `strdup(cookie_path)`) before reassigning it to a new dynamically allocated string (e.g., by calling `strdup` internally), then the original memory will be leaked. This memory leak occurs when the `new_path[0] != '/'` condition is met and `strstore` is invoked."
