"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","A product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unexpected behavior.","The `strcmp` function is used to compare the input `name` with `desc->name`. If the `name` parameter, which is an input to this function, is not guaranteed to be null-terminated, `strcmp` will read past the end of the buffer allocated for `name` until it encounters a null byte or an invalid memory address. This constitutes a buffer over-read vulnerability, which can lead to denial of service (crashes) or potentially information disclosure if sensitive data is located immediately after the buffer in memory. The code does not perform any explicit length checks or null-termination guarantees on the `name` input before passing it to `strcmp`."
"2","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can be caused by incorrect index calculation, incorrect length calculation, or improper null termination.","The function uses strcmp(name, desc->name) to compare an input string 'name' with known annotation names. If the 'name' parameter, which could originate from untrusted input, is not properly null-terminated, the strcmp function will read past the end of the buffer allocated for 'name' until a null byte is encountered or an access violation occurs. This constitutes a buffer over-read vulnerability, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
