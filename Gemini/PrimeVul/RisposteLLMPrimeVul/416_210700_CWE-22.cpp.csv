"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code uses strcpy to copy a directory entry name (dire->name) into a fixed-size buffer within a struct dir_ent (dir->dirs[dir->dir_count].name). The maximum length of dire->name is determined by SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN (up to SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN - 1 characters plus null terminator). If the size of the destination buffer dir->dirs[dir->dir_count].name is smaller than SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN, a buffer overflow will occur when processing a directory entry with a filename of maximum allowed length, leading to potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure.","The code uses strcpy to copy the directory entry name (dire->name) into a member of a dynamically allocated structure (dir->dirs[dir->dir_count].name). While the source buffer dire->name is bounded by SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN (due to the dire->size check and the buffer allocation), there is no corresponding size check or length-limited copy function (like strncpy or strlcpy) used for the destination buffer. If the fixed-size buffer dir->dirs[dir->dir_count].name (which is part of struct dir_ent) is smaller than SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN + 1, a buffer overflow will occur when a long filename is encountered. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
