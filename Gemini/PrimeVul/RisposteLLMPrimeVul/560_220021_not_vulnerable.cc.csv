"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or control flow.","The code uses an 'int' type for the loop counter 'i' in the 'for (int i = 0; i < num_entries; ++i)' loop, while 'num_entries' is of type 'int64_t'. If 'num_entries' exceeds the maximum value an 'int' can hold (INT_MAX), the loop counter 'i' will overflow and wrap around. This can lead to an infinite loop, incorrect processing of data, or incomplete data copies, as not all elements specified by 'num_entries' will be iterated over correctly."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the result of the calculation will always be larger than the maximum value for the integer type, or that the result will always be smaller than the minimum value for the integer type.","The code uses an 'int' type for the loop counter 'i' in the 'for (int i = 0; i < num_entries; ++i)' loop, while the loop limit 'num_entries' is of type 'int64_t'. If 'num_entries' exceeds the maximum value representable by an 'int' (INT_MAX), the loop counter 'i' will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to out-of-bounds access when 'i' is subsequently used to index 'output_indices_t' and 'output_values_t', potentially resulting in memory corruption, crashes, or information disclosure."
