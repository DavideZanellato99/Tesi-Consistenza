"1","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates an excessive amount of memory or other resources, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service by exhausting available resources.","The code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation. In the NODE_STR case, the length variable 'len' is derived from '(intptr_t)tree->cdr'. If an attacker can craft a malicious Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) where the 'cdr' field of a NODE_STR node contains an arbitrarily large integer value, the 'mrb_str_new' function will attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service for the application. This is an improper input validation vulnerability concerning the AST structure."
