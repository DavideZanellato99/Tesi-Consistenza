"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit. This is a common issue in C and C++ programs, often resulting from improper error handling or unexpected input.","The code directly dereferences the 'what_arg' pointer to access 'what_arg->v_type' without first checking if 'what_arg' itself is a NULL pointer. If 'what_arg' is NULL when this function is called, attempting to access 'what_arg->v_type' will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, leading to a crash or denial of service.","The code passes the 'wp' pointer to 'get_errorlist' and 'qf_get_properties' functions. The conditional check 'if (is_qf || wp != NULL)' allows 'wp' to be NULL if 'is_qf' is true. If 'is_qf' is true and 'wp' is NULL, and the called functions do not explicitly handle a NULL 'wp' argument, a NULL pointer dereference will occur, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
