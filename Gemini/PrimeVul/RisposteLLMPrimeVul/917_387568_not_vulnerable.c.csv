"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The function passes a user-controlled size parameter directly to a kernel callback function without any prior validation. This allows an attacker to provide an arbitrarily large or otherwise malicious size value, which if not properly handled by the callback, could lead to resource exhaustion, buffer overflows, or information leaks."
"2","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index or Size","The product uses an array index or size that is not properly validated, leading to out-of-bounds read or write.","The 'size' parameter, which is user-controlled, is passed directly to the 'kctl->tlv.c' handler without any prior validation. An attacker could provide an excessively large value for 'size', potentially leading to a denial of service (e.g., by causing large memory allocations or excessive CPU usage in the handler) or, if the handler does not correctly bounds-check its internal buffers, to buffer overflows or information leaks. This function, as the entry point receiving the user-controlled size, should validate it before passing it to a sensitive handler."
