"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code does not check the return value of p_malloc. If p_malloc fails to allocate memory (e.g., due to out-of-memory conditions or if len is 0 and p_malloc returns NULL for zero-sized allocations), *buffer will be NULL. Subsequently, memcpy attempts to dereference this NULL pointer, leading to a null pointer dereference and a potential crash or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, and the pointer's value is NULL.
