"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this condition. This can lead to resultant data that is smaller or larger than expected. When this value is used in a subsequent operation, it can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The code calculates a total size by repeatedly adding values to ptr->size. If ptr->num_views or ptr->views[i].num_ref_views are sufficiently large, the u32 variable ptr->size can overflow, leading to an incorrect, smaller size. This incorrect size could then be used in subsequent memory allocation or buffer operations, potentially resulting in a heap buffer overflow or other memory corruption."

If ptr->num_views is not properly validated and exceeds the actual allocated size of the views array, an out-of-bounds read will occur when ptr->views[i] is accessed, leading to undefined behavior, potential crashes, or information disclosure."
