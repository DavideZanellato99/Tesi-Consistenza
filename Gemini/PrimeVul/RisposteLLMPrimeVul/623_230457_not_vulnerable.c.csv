"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The function `create_llao` performs write operations (direct assignments, memcpy, memset) into the `llao` buffer without validating its size. The size of the `llao` buffer is not passed as an argument, making it impossible for the function to perform bounds checking. If the caller provides a buffer smaller than the total size required by the `UIP_ND6_OPT_*` and `UIP_LLADDR_LEN` constants, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The function `create_llao` accepts a `uint8_t *llao` buffer without a corresponding size parameter. It then performs multiple writes using array indexing, `memcpy`, and `memset` based on internal constants like `UIP_ND6_OPT_TYPE_OFFSET`, `UIP_ND6_OPT_LEN_OFFSET`, `UIP_ND6_OPT_DATA_OFFSET`, `UIP_LLADDR_LEN`, and `UIP_ND6_OPT_LLAO_LEN`. If the buffer provided by the caller is not sufficiently large to accommodate these writes, an out-of-bounds write will occur, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in data corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
