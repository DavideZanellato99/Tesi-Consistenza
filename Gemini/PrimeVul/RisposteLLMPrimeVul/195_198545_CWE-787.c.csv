"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to uncontrolled resource consumption. The 'length' variable, which dictates the total number of bytes to read from the I2C device and print, is directly parsed from user input (argv[3]) using hextoul without any upper bound validation. An attacker can supply an arbitrarily large value for 'length', causing the main 'do-while' loop to execute an excessive number of iterations. Each iteration performs an I2C read operation and prints data to the console, leading to significant consumption of CPU cycles and I2C bus time, thereby causing a denial of service for other system operations."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value, or that the value will not wrap around. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The 'length' variable, an unsigned integer (uint), is assigned to 'nbytes', a signed integer (int). If a user provides a 'length' value greater than INT_MAX, 'nbytes' will wrap around and become a negative value. This causes the subsequent 'do-while' loop, which controls the data reading and printing, to not execute at all, leading to a denial of service for the command as no data will be read or displayed."
