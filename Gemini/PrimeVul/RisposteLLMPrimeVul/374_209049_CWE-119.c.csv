"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, which might cause the resource to be consumed indefinitely.","The function can leak memory if xmlCtxtGrowAttrs fails during attribute parsing. If attributes have already been parsed and their values were allocated (not pointers into the input buffer), these previously allocated attribute values are stored in ctxt->atts and marked in ctxt->attallocs. When xmlCtxtGrowAttrs fails, the code jumps to the failed: label, which only frees the currently processed attribute value. The cleanup loop that frees all previously allocated attribute values (controlled by the attval flag) is skipped, leading to a memory leak."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime, which might cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs or to the product itself.","The code contains a memory leak vulnerability. When parsing attributes, if xmlParseAttribute2 allocates memory for an attribute value (indicated by 'alloc' being true) but the attribute cannot be successfully stored (e.g., due to xmlCtxtGrowAttrs failing or if attname or attvalue is NULL), the allocated memory for attvalue is conditionally freed only if attvalue[len] == 0. This condition is incorrect; the memory should be freed unconditionally if it was allocated, regardless of its content or null-termination, leading to a memory leak if attvalue[len] is not zero."
