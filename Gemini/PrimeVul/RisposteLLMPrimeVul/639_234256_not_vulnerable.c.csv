"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly. This can lead to various issues, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other unexpected behavior if the input is malformed or malicious.","The function display_augmentation_data takes 'data' and 'len' as input parameters, which could originate from untrusted sources. It passes these parameters directly to the 'display_data' function without performing any validation on their values. This lack of input validation before passing potentially untrusted data to a processing function could enable vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, or null pointer dereferences in 'display_data' if 'len' is maliciously crafted or 'data' is an invalid pointer."
