"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to control flow hijacking or denial of service.","The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. Several fixed-size arrays (arridx, curi, tword, wordcount) are allocated on the stack using the MAXWLEN constant. The 'depth' variable, which is used as an index into these arrays, is incremented without any bounds checking against MAXWLEN. If the input trie structure (derived from slang) has a depth greater than or equal to MAXWLEN, the 'depth' variable will exceed the allocated array bounds, leading to out-of-bounds writes when accessing elements like arridx[depth], curi[depth], tword[depth], or wordcount[depth]. This can result in denial of service, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
