"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can be caused by incorrect indexing, pointer arithmetic, or by providing a length value that is larger than the buffer. A buffer over-read can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or exposure of sensitive information.","The str_foldcase function is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. It takes a source string 'str' and its length 'orglen' as parameters. During the initial copy, mch_memmove is called to copy 'orglen' bytes from 'str'. If the 'orglen' value provided by the caller is greater than the actual allocated size of the memory pointed to by 'str', mch_memmove will attempt to read data beyond the legal bounds of 'str'. This can lead to a program crash (e.g., segmentation fault), information disclosure by reading sensitive data from adjacent memory regions, or other undefined and potentially exploitable behavior. The function does not perform any validation to ensure that 'orglen' is a safe length for the 'str' buffer."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","Integer Overflow or Wraparound occurs when a program performs a calculation that results in an integer value that is too large to be stored in the intended data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service, especially when the result of the overflow is used in subsequent memory allocation or indexing operations, bypassing intended security checks.","The code snippet contains an integer overflow vulnerability that can lead to a buffer overflow. When 'buf' is not NULL, the function calculates a potential new string length using 'len + nlen - olen'. If 'len' is sufficiently large (e.g., 'buflen - 1') and 'nlen - olen' is a positive value, this sum can exceed the maximum value for an 'int' and overflow. If the sum overflows and wraps around to a negative value, the subsequent bounds check 'len + nlen - olen >= buflen' will incorrectly evaluate to false, bypassing the intended size validation. This allows 'STRMOVE' to write data beyond the allocated 'buf' boundary, resulting in an out-of-bounds write."
