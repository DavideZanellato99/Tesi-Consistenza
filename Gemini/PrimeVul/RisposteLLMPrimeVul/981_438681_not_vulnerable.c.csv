"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, leading to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The code dereferences svq->vdev->priv to obtain vrp and then accesses vrp->sendq without checking if svq->vdev->priv is a valid non-NULL pointer. If svq->vdev->priv is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a system crash or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has a NULL value, which typically results in a program crash or termination. This can lead to a denial of service or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the memory location pointed to by the NULL pointer.","The function rpmsg_xmit_done dereferences the svq pointer, svq->vdev pointer, and svq->vdev->priv pointer without prior validation. If any of these pointers are NULL, a NULL pointer dereference will occur, leading to a system crash or denial of service."
