"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, leading to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The code directly dereferences the 'pfid' and 'parms' pointers without checking if they are NULL. If either pointer is NULL when the function is called, it will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, typically because the pointer was not assigned to point to a valid memory address. This often leads to a crash or denial of service.","The function smb2_sync_read dereferences the pfid and parms pointers without first checking if they are NULL. If either pfid or parms is a null pointer when this function is called, accessing their members (pfid->persistent_fid, pfid->volatile_fid, parms->persistent_fid, parms->volatile_fid) will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or denial of service."
