"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet uses kvmalloc_array, which is a safe kernel memory allocation function designed to prevent integer overflows during size calculation. The function itself is a simple wrapper and does not introduce any vulnerabilities. The caller is responsible for checking the return value for NULL and freeing the allocated memory."

"5","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet uses kvmalloc_array which is a safe kernel memory allocation function designed to prevent integer overflows when calculating the total allocation size. It internally checks for n * size overflow before performing the allocation, returning NULL on failure. The snippet itself does not introduce a vulnerability."
