"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer that is allocated on the stack, but the size of the input buffer can be greater than the size of the output buffer. This can lead to an overwrite of data on the stack, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.","The code allocates a buffer on the stack to store a squashfs_dir_entry_3 structure and a variable-length filename. The 'dire' pointer is cast to the beginning of this buffer. After reading the fixed-size squashfs_dir_entry_3 structure into 'dire', the code attempts to read the filename into 'dire->name'. However, 'dire->name' is a member *within* the squashfs_dir_entry_3 structure itself (likely a small placeholder array like char name[1]), not the memory region immediately following the structure where the variable-length filename should be stored. This results in the filename data being written starting at the address of 'dire->name', overwriting other fields of the squashfs_dir_entry_3 structure that were just read into the buffer. This leads to data corruption within the structure and constitutes a stack-based buffer overflow. Additionally, the null termination 'dire->name[dire->size + 1] = '\0';' attempts to write one byte past the intended end of the filename (assuming 'dire->size + 1' bytes were read including the null terminator), which is another potential out-of-bounds write."
