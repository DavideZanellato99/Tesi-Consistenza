"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to an incorrect result that can cause buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The code calculates gather_dim_size and inner_size by multiplying multiple int64_t dimension sizes. If the product of these dimension sizes exceeds the maximum value for int64_t, an integer overflow will occur. This overflow will result in an incorrect, typically smaller, value for gather_dim_size or inner_size. These incorrect values are then used to create a view of the params tensor (params_flat) using params.shaped<T, 3>. An incorrectly sized tensor view can lead to out-of-bounds memory access (read) when the GatherFunctor attempts to read data from params_flat, potentially causing a crash, data corruption, or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two numbers is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. This can result in a buffer overflow, incorrect calculations, or other issues.","The code calculates gather_dim_size and inner_size by multiplying dimension sizes of the params tensor. These calculations are performed using int64_t. If the product of these dimension sizes exceeds std::numeric_limits<int64_t>::max(), an integer overflow will occur, causing gather_dim_size or inner_size to wrap around to a smaller or negative value. These incorrect values are then used to reshape the params tensor into params_flat. The GatherFunctor subsequently operates on this params_flat view, which, due to the overflow, may have an incorrect size or stride. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access (read or write) when the functor attempts to access elements within params_flat, potentially causing a crash, data corruption, or information disclosure. The existing OP_REQUIRES check only validates individual index values against params.dim_size(0) and does not prevent issues arising from the overflowed intermediate dimension calculations."
