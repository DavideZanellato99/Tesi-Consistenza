"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates over a rectangular region of the VNC framebuffer defined by x, y, w, h. It uses fbptr[dx] to access pixels within a row and advances fbptr by vnc_server_fb_stride(vd) for each new row. There are no explicit checks within this function to ensure that the calculated memory accesses remain within the allocated bounds of the VNC framebuffer. If an attacker can supply x, y, w, h values that cause the region to extend beyond the framebuffer's dimensions, an out-of-bounds read will occur. This could lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive memory) or a denial of service (crashing the server)."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can often lead to crashes or other failures that result in a denial of service. It can also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, or even arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In the inner loop, `fbptr[dx]` is accessed for `dx` from `0` to `w-1`. If the provided width `w` exceeds the actual width of the framebuffer from the starting `x` coordinate, then `fbptr[dx]` will read past the end of the current scanline's allocated memory. This can lead to information disclosure or a crash if an attacker provides a malicious `w` value."
