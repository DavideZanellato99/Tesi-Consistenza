"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that input. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial of service.","The code contains several CHECK macros (e.g., CHECK(!conn.oneRttWriteCipher.get()), CHECK(handshakeReadHeaderCipher), CHECK(conn.oneRttWriteCipher)). These macros typically act as assertions that terminate the program if their condition is false. If a malicious client can send specially crafted or out-of-order packets that cause the connection state to become inconsistent, thereby triggering one of these CHECK failures, it would lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the server process. This represents a vulnerability where improper client input can lead to server termination by violating expected protocol invariants."
"2","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs concurrent execution using a shared resource, but it does not properly synchronize the accesses to that resource. This can lead to a race condition, which can have various impacts depending on the nature of the shared resource and the operations performed on it.","The function modifies various members of the QuicServerConnectionState object, such as ciphers and transport parameters. If updateHandshakeState is called concurrently on the same connection object from multiple threads without external synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes), it can lead to race conditions. These race conditions could result in inconsistent connection state, incorrect cipher usage, data corruption, or denial of service due to unexpected program behavior or crashes."
