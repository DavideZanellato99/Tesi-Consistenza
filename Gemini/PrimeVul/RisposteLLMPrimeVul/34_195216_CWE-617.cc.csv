"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be larger than it is, or that it has not wrapped around. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other weaknesses.","The variable `arg_index` is declared as an `int` but is initialized with `result_.nodes.size()`, which is of type `size_t`. `size_t` is an unsigned type typically larger than `int` (e.g., 64-bit vs. 32-bit). If `result_.nodes.size()` exceeds `INT_MAX`, an integer overflow will occur during initialization, causing `arg_index` to wrap around to a negative or unexpectedly small positive value. Subsequent increments to `arg_index` within the loop can also cause overflow. This overflowed value is then used as an attribute `AddAttr(""index"", arg_index, gnode);`. If downstream code relies on this ""index"" attribute being a valid, non-negative, or appropriately bounded index for array access or other operations, this could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, incorrect program behavior, or denial of service."
