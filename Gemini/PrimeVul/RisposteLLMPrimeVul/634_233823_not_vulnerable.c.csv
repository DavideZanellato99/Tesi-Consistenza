"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The function performs an out-of-bounds write to the 'dstpal' array. The loop iterates 'ncolors_to_read' times, writing to 'dstpal[i]'. However, the function does not validate 'ncolors_to_read' against the actual allocated size of 'dstpal'. If 'ncolors_to_read' is larger than the buffer's capacity, it will result in memory corruption, leading to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution. A similar out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists for the 'dbuf *f' buffer via 'dbuf_getu16be(f, pos + i*2)' if 'pos + i*2' exceeds its bounds."
