"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime, which might cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs or to the product itself.","The code calls html_quote(q) and assigns the result to qq. It also calls Sprintf which likely allocates a new string. If html_quote and Sprintf allocate memory for the strings they return (which is typical for functions that escape or format strings), this memory is not explicitly freed within the process_button function. The qq variable and the temporary string created by Sprintf are local to this function and their allocated memory will be leaked on each call, leading to a gradual consumption of memory and potential denial of service over time."

"3","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code calls strlen(q) on a variable 'q' which is populated by parsedtag_get_value. If parsedtag_get_value returns a pointer to a buffer that is not null-terminated, strlen(q) will read past the end of the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This could result in a crash (denial of service) or potentially information disclosure. The html_quote function, also called with 'q', 'p', and 'r', would likely suffer from the same vulnerability if it internally relies on null-termination without proper length checks."
