"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product attempts to free memory that has already been freed. This can corrupt heap metadata, leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code creates a new red::shared_ptr from a raw RedChannel *channel pointer. If the channel pointer is already managed by another shared_ptr instance elsewhere in the program, this will lead to two independent shared_ptr control blocks managing the same memory. When both shared_ptr instances go out of scope, they will both attempt to deallocate the same RedChannel object, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The code creates a new red::shared_ptr from a raw pointer 'channel'. If 'channel' is already managed by another red::shared_ptr or std::shared_ptr, this will lead to two independent smart pointers attempting to free the same memory, resulting in a double-free vulnerability. Alternatively, if 'channel' points to a stack-allocated object, the shared_ptr will attempt to delete a stack object, causing memory corruption. This pattern is a common source of memory management errors."
