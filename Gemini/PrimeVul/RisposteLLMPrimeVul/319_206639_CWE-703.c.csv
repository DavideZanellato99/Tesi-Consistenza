"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product allocates memory or resources, but it does not free or release the memory or resources after they are no longer needed. This can lead to a denial of service if the product consumes all available memory or resources.","The code increments the 'use' counter of a 'nft_chain' object when handling 'NFT_JUMP' or 'NFT_GOTO' verdicts. This 'use' counter acts as a reference count. However, there is no corresponding decrement of this counter when the verdict is no longer in use, such as when the rule containing this verdict is deleted or updated. This leads to a resource leak, as the 'nft_chain' object's reference count may never drop to zero, preventing its proper deallocation and cleanup."
