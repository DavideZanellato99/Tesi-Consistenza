"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The code calculates a string length (value.slen) from a length field (attr->hdr.length) read directly from the input buffer (buf) without proper validation against the actual buffer size. This length is then used by pj_strdup to copy data. If an attacker provides a crafted input buffer with a manipulated attr->hdr.length value that exceeds the actual buffer's bounds, an out-of-bounds read will occur when pj_strdup attempts to access memory beyond the end of buf."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The function performs direct memory accesses (buf[6], buf[7]) and a string copy (pj_strdup) based on length information (attr->hdr.length) read from an input buffer (buf). There is no explicit bounds checking on the 'buf' pointer or the calculated lengths before these operations. An attacker could craft a malformed STUN message with an error code attribute where the provided buffer 'buf' is shorter than expected or the 'attr->hdr.length' field indicates a length that would cause an out-of-bounds read, leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
