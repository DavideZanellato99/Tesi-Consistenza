"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses the input parameter 'c1' directly to calculate an array index 'ctxIdxInc' via the assignment 'ctxSet = c1;'. This 'ctxIdxInc' is then used as an offset to access the 'tctx->ctx_model' array. There is no validation or bounds checking performed on the value of 'c1' before it is used in the index calculation. An attacker could provide a crafted value for 'c1' that results in 'ctxIdxInc' being outside the valid bounds of the 'tctx->ctx_model' array, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can cause a crash (denial of service), information disclosure, or potentially lead to further exploitation."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The `c1` parameter, which can be an arbitrary integer, is directly used to calculate an index (`ctxIdxInc`) for the `tctx->ctx_model` array without any bounds checking. Specifically, `ctxSet` is assigned `c1`, and `ctxIdxInc` is calculated as `(ctxSet*4) + ...`. If `c1` is controlled by an attacker and not properly validated, it can lead to `ctxIdxInc` being an out-of-bounds index. This results in an out-of-bounds memory access (read and/or write) when `decode_CABAC_bit` attempts to use `&tctx->ctx_model[CONTEXT_MODEL_COEFF_ABS_LEVEL_GREATER1_FLAG + ctxIdxInc]`. Such an access can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
