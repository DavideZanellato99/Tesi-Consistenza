"1","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle exceptional conditions, which can lead to a variety of weaknesses.","The code uses `ValueOrDie()` on the result of `full_type::SpecializeType` without checking if the operation was successful. If an attacker can provide a `node_def` that causes `SpecializeType` to return an error status, the program will terminate, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS)."
"2","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle exceptional conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or termination.","The code uses ctor_type.ValueOrDie() on the result of full_type::SpecializeType. If SpecializeType encounters an error, for example due to malformed input in node_def attributes or op_reg_data->op_def, ValueOrDie() will cause the program to terminate, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. The StatusOr object returned by SpecializeType should be checked for ok() before attempting to extract its value."
