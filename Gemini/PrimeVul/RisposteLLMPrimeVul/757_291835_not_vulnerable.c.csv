"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or data corruption.","The code reads the sg_cnt field from a network message (msg) and uses it as a loop bound to access msg->desc[sgi] without validating that sg_cnt does not exceed the actual allocated size of the msg buffer or the maximum number of descriptors it can safely hold. An attacker can provide a crafted message with an excessively large sg_cnt, leading to an out-of-bounds read from memory adjacent to the msg buffer. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially lead to further exploitation."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code uses an attacker-controlled value, msg->sg_cnt, to determine the loop bounds for accessing msg->desc[sgi]. If sg_cnt is larger than the actual allocated size of the desc array within the msg structure, an out-of-bounds read will occur, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service. There is no explicit check to validate sg_cnt against the actual buffer size of msg."
