"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The function find_next_quote iterates through the line buffer without checking its bounds. It relies solely on a NUL terminator to prevent reading past the end of the buffer. If the provided line buffer is not null-terminated within its allocated size, and the target quotechar is not found, the column index will increment indefinitely, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in application crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended input buffer.","The function find_next_quote iterates through the 'line' buffer using the 'col' index. The loop continues indefinitely until a null terminator ('NUL') is encountered or the 'quotechar' is found. If the 'line' buffer is not null-terminated and the 'quotechar' is not found within the allocated memory region, the 'col' index will increment beyond the buffer's boundaries, leading to an out-of-bounds read when accessing 'line[col]'.
