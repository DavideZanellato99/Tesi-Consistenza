"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.","The memcpy call attempts to copy a fixed size (sizeof(struct capability)) into the cap structure from the network buffer. However, the preceding bounds check `if (pnt + 3 > end)` only ensures that at least 3 bytes are available for the action, code, and length fields. If `sizeof(struct capability)` is greater than the remaining bytes in the buffer after the action byte, the `memcpy` will read past the end of the provided `pnt` buffer, leading to a buffer over-read. This can result in information disclosure or a denial of service. The `cap.length` field, which is used for subsequent bounds checks and pointer advancement, is read as part of this potentially out-of-bounds operation, making the control flow susceptible to manipulation."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs a memcpy into the 'cap' structure using 'sizeof(struct capability)' bytes. However, the preceding length check 'if (pnt + 3 > end)' only ensures that there are at least 2 bytes available for the capability code and length fields after the action byte. If 'sizeof(struct capability)' is greater than 2 bytes (which is likely, especially if it includes fields like 'mpc.afi' and 'mpc.safi'), the memcpy will read beyond the bounds of the provided message buffer. This out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure, denial of service (crash), or allow an attacker to control subsequent program flow by corrupting the 'cap' structure, potentially leading to out-of-bounds writes when 'cap.mpc.afi' and 'cap.mpc.safi' are later used as array indices."
