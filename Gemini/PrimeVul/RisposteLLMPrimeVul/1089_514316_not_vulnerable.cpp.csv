"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit in a critical component, or to a bypass of security checks.","The code dereferences 'thd' and 'thd->lex' without prior null checks. If 'thd' or 'thd->lex' is a null pointer, this will lead to a program crash (segmentation fault) or undefined behavior, potentially allowing for denial of service."
