"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","A use-after-free is an attempt to access memory after it has been freed. When memory is freed, it is returned to the system and can be reallocated for other purposes. If a program continues to use a pointer to the freed memory, it can lead to various issues, including crashes, corruption of data, or even arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the reallocated memory.","The sqlite3_column_text and sqlite3_column_blob functions return pointers to internal buffers managed by SQLite. These pointers are only valid until the next call to sqlite3_step(), sqlite3_reset(), or sqlite3_finalize() on the prepared statement. If the Values::Text and Values::Blob objects store these pointers directly without making a deep copy of the underlying data, and the Row object (or the Values objects within it) outlives the current step of the sqlite3_stmt, then subsequent access to these stored pointers will result in use-after-free, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential data corruption."

"4","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","The program accesses memory that has been freed. Accessing freed memory can lead to a program crash, corrupt data, or in some cases, arbitrary code execution.
