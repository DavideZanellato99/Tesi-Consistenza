"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code iterates over 'length' (derived from 'm_ulWidth[0]') times, incrementing a pointer 'lp' which points to 'line->m_pData'. There is no explicit check to ensure that 'm_ulWidth[0]' does not exceed the actual allocated size of the buffer pointed to by 'line->m_pData'. If 'm_ulWidth[0]' is larger than the buffer's capacity, the pointer 'lp' will eventually go out of bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read when '*lp' is dereferenced, and potentially an out-of-bounds write if functions like 'UpdateContext' modify memory based on the out-of-bounds 'lp'. This can result in crashes (Denial of Service), information disclosure, or even arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or in some cases, allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates over pixel data using a pointer 'lp' and a length counter 'length' derived from 'm_ulWidth[0]'. If 'm_ulWidth[0]' exceeds the actual allocated size of the 'line->m_pData' buffer, the 'lp' pointer will increment beyond the buffer's boundary. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when dereferencing '*lp' and potentially an out-of-bounds write if 'UpdateContext' modifies memory at or near 'lp'. An attacker controlling 'm_ulWidth[0]' (e.g., via a malformed input file) could exploit this to cause data corruption, application crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
