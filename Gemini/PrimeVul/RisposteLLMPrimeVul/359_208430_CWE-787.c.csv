"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function hid_debug_events_read copies data from an internal kernel buffer (list->hid_debug_buf) to a user-provided buffer (buffer). However, it fails to limit the total amount of data copied to the 'count' parameter, which specifies the maximum number of bytes the user's buffer can hold. The 'ret' variable accumulates the total bytes copied from the internal buffer, but there is no check to ensure 'ret' does not exceed 'count'. Consequently, if the internal buffer contains more data than the user requested or allocated space for, the copy_to_user calls will write past the end of the user-provided 'buffer', leading to an out-of-bounds write in user space. This can result in denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution in the user process."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function copies data from a kernel buffer (list->hid_debug_buf) to a user-provided buffer without adequately checking the user's specified maximum size (count parameter). The variables 'len' and 'ret' accumulate the amount of data to be copied and the total copied bytes, respectively, but are not constrained by 'count'. If the amount of data available in the kernel's circular buffer exceeds the 'count' value, the 'copy_to_user' calls will attempt to write beyond the bounds of the user's allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow in user space."
