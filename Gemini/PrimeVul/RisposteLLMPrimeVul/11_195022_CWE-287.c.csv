"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit of the product, causing a denial of service. This typically occurs when a pointer is used before it has been checked to ensure it is not NULL.","The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. When processing the 'scheme_type' parameter from the JSON input, the code checks if the 'scheme_type' key is missing but fails to check if the value associated with 'scheme_type' is actually a string before calling json_string_value. If an attacker provides a non-string value for 'scheme_type' (e.g., an integer or boolean), json_string_value will return NULL. This NULL pointer is then passed to o_strcmp, which will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly handles an unusual or exceptional condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The code calls json_string_value(json_object_get(j_result, ""username"")) without validating that the ""username"" field within the j_result JSON object is actually a string or even present. The j_result object is returned by auth_check_identify_scheme. If auth_check_identify_scheme returns a JSON object where the ""username"" field is missing or contains a non-string JSON type (e.g., an integer, boolean, array, or object), calling json_string_value on such a value will lead to undefined behavior, most likely a program crash (segmentation fault). This allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service."
