"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet implements a security check using SELinux APIs to determine if a parent process has permission to trace a child process. It correctly utilizes avc_has_perm with appropriate subject, object, and permission types for the PTRACE_TRACEME operation. The snippet itself does not introduce any security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or incorrect logic in the security check. It serves as a security control."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet performs a standard SELinux permission check using avc_has_perm to determine if a parent process is allowed to ptrace the current process. It correctly retrieves security IDs for the subject and object tasks and specifies the security class and permission. This function is an enforcement mechanism and does not contain any direct programming vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free issues."
