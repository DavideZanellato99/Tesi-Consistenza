"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function m_mday dereferences the pointer x (e.g., x->s.mday, x->c.mday, x->s.pc, x->c.pc, and likely within simple_dat_p(x), get_s_civil(x), get_c_civil(x)) without first checking if x is a null pointer. If m_mday is called with a NULL argument for x, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash (e.g., segmentation fault)."

"3","True","CWE-908","Use of Uninitialized Resource","The software uses a resource that has not been initialized.

If these initialization functions do not guarantee that the specific fields being read (mday or pc) are always initialized, then the subsequent read operation will access uninitialized memory, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or information disclosure."
