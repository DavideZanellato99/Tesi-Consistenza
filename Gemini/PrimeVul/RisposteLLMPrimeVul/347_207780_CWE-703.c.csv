"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to corruption of data, a crash, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains a heap buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) vulnerability. The 'deps' array is allocated with a size determined by 'cache->hdr->imagesCount'. Inside a loop, 'dep_index' is calculated from 'depArray[k] & 0x7fff'. The maximum value for 'dep_index' is 32767. If 'cache->hdr->imagesCount' is less than this maximum possible 'dep_index' value, an attacker can craft input such that 'dep_index' exceeds the allocated size of the 'deps' array. When 'deps[dep_index]++' is executed, it will write past the allocated boundary of the 'deps' array, corrupting adjacent heap memory. This can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read and write issues. In the loop iterating with variable 'k' (for k = extras[j].dependentsStartArrayIndex; depArray[k] != 0xffff; k++), the index 'k' is not checked against the allocated size of 'depArray' (cache->accel->depListCount). This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the sentinel value 0xffff is not found within the array bounds or if dependentsStartArrayIndex is already out of bounds. Furthermore, the 'dep_index' variable, derived from depArray[k] & 0x7fff, is used to access 'deps[dep_index]++' and '&img[dep_index]'. If 'dep_index' exceeds the allocated sizes of 'deps' (cache->hdr->imagesCount) or 'img' (hdr->imagesCount), it results in an out-of-bounds write and an out-of-bounds read, respectively. An attacker can craft a malicious dyldcache file to control these indices, leading to memory corruption, information disclosure, or denial of service."
