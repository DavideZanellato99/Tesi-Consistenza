"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains a critical vulnerability due to incorrect pointer arithmetic. Inside a conditional block, the pointer `fd` (of type `gerb_file_t *`) is incremented using `fd++`. This operation modifies the `fd` pointer itself to point to an arbitrary memory location `sizeof(gerb_file_t)` bytes beyond its original valid address. Subsequently, the function `get_line` is called with this corrupted `fd` pointer. This will cause `get_line` to attempt to access members of a `gerb_file_t` structure at an invalid memory address, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write, resulting in a crash (e.g., segmentation fault) or potentially allowing an attacker to achieve arbitrary memory access and execution. Additionally, the line `fd->ptr -= 4;` could cause a buffer underflow if `fd->ptr` is close to the beginning of its buffer, further contributing to memory corruption."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code uses `tool_num` as an index into the `image->aperture` array. While there is a check for `tool_num` being out of bounds (`tool_num < TOOL_MIN || tool_num >= TOOL_MAX`), this check only prints an error message and does not prevent the subsequent out-of-bounds access to `image->aperture[tool_num]`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when `apert` is assigned, and an out-of-bounds write when `image->aperture[tool_num]` is later assigned a new `gerbv_aperture_t` object, potentially causing a crash or memory corruption. Furthermore, the `get_line(fd++)` call incorrectly increments the `fd` pointer itself, leading to undefined behavior."
