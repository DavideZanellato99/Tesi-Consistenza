"1","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for an unusual or exceptional condition, which can lead to a vulnerability. This often occurs when developers assume that certain conditions will not occur, or that they are not important enough to check. However, an attacker may be able to force these conditions to occur, leading to unexpected behavior or a security vulnerability.","The code snippet contains a switch statement with a default case that calls FAIL(). If the 'op' parameter can be controlled by an attacker and an unhandled enum value is provided, this will lead to a program termination or crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The FAIL() macro typically indicates an unrecoverable error, which in a security context, can be exploited to disrupt service availability."
"2","True","CWE-617","Reachable Assertion","The product contains an assertion that is reachable by an attacker, which can lead to a denial of service or other impact.","The default case in the switch statement calls FAIL(). If FAIL() is implemented as an assertion or a function that terminates the program, and an attacker can provide an 'op' value that is not one of the explicitly handled BuiltinOperator values, this will trigger the FAIL() call, leading to a Denial of Service. This vulnerability exists if the 'op' parameter is derived from untrusted input without sufficient validation to ensure it falls within the expected range of BuiltinOperator enum values."
