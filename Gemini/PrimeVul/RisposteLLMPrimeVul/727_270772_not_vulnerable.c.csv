"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The function to_hexa does not validate its input c to ensure it is within the expected range of 0-15 for a hexadecimal digit. If c is greater than 15, the function will return an incorrect ASCII character that is not a valid hexadecimal digit (e.g., 'g', 'h', or other characters due to unsigned char wraparound), potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior in consuming code."
