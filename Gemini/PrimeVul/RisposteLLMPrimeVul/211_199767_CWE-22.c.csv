"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without checking whether the input buffer is larger than the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code uses a fixed-size buffer (buffer[256]) and repeatedly appends user-controlled data (derived from extensions_str) to it using strcat within a loop. The strcat function does not perform bounds checking, allowing an attacker to provide a long extensions_str that, when processed, will cause the total length of the concatenated string to exceed 256 bytes. This leads to a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior."
