"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the disclosure of sensitive information.","The code accesses an array element using the ctDepth parameter as an index (model[ctDepth]). If ctDepth is not properly validated to ensure it remains within the allocated bounds of the model array, an attacker could provide a crafted input that causes an out-of-bounds read. This could lead to information disclosure, a crash, or other undefined behavior."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code accesses the 'model' array using the 'ctDepth' parameter as an index ('&model[ctDepth]'). The 'ctDepth' parameter's range is not validated within this function. If 'ctDepth' can be controlled by an attacker (e.g., via a malformed input bitstream) or if a prior calculation error results in an out-of-bounds value, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read from the 'model' array. This can cause a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
