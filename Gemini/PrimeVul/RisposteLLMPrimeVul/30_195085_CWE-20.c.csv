"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet implements a seccomp filter using libseccomp. It initializes the filter to allow all syscalls by default and then adds specific rules to block a comprehensive list of dangerous syscalls and restrict socket families. The implementation correctly handles architecture-specific rules, conditional blocking based on development flags, and precise socket family filtering. Error handling for libseccomp calls and temporary file operations is present. Resource management for the seccomp context and file descriptors is also correctly handled. There are no apparent coding vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, race conditions, or logical errors in the filter construction that would lead to a bypass or crash. The effectiveness of the seccomp policy itself (i.e., whether the chosen blocklist is exhaustive enough) is a design-level consideration rather than a coding vulnerability in this snippet."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C/C++ code snippet implements a seccomp filter designed to enhance the security of a sandboxed environment by restricting system calls and socket families. The code initializes a seccomp filter with a default allow policy and then explicitly adds rules to block a comprehensive list of potentially dangerous system calls (e.g., related to namespaces, kernel keyrings, ptrace, perf events, old syscalls, and specific ioctls). It also implements a robust allowlist mechanism for socket families, blocking any family not explicitly permitted or falling between allowed families. The logic for adding rules, handling different architectures, and managing conditional flags appears sound. Error handling is present for critical seccomp operations. The overall design aims to reduce the attack surface and is a security-hardening measure, not a source of vulnerability itself. There are no apparent flaws in the seccomp rule logic, integer overflows, or missing error checks that would lead to a security vulnerability within this snippet."
