"1","True","CWE-562","Dereferencing of a Non-existent Object (Dangling Pointer)","The product dereferences a pointer that refers to a memory location that has been freed, deallocated, or is otherwise invalid.","The code assigns the 'name' pointer directly to 'new_field->field_name' without copying the string data. If the memory pointed to by 'name' has a shorter lifetime than 'new_field', subsequent access to 'new_field->field_name' will result in dereferencing a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential memory corruption."

"4","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","A Use After Free vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or arbitrary code execution.","The code assigns the 'name' pointer directly to 'new_field->field_name' without making a deep copy of the string. If the 'name' parameter points to memory that is temporary or stack-allocated by the caller, and that memory is deallocated before 'new_field' is destroyed or its 'field_name' is no longer needed, accessing 'new_field->field_name' will result in a use-after-free vulnerability or a read of invalid memory. This creates a dangling pointer."
