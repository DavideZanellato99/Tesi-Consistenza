"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code allocates a buffer 'b' of size 'size'. Later, it performs a memcmp operation on 'b + 8' for 4 bytes. If the calculated 'size' (r_buf_size(buf) - off) is less than 12 bytes, this memcmp will attempt to read past the end of the allocated buffer 'b', leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in a crash (denial of service) or the exposure of sensitive information from adjacent memory regions."
"2","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. If the initial magic number check fails (magicCombo != 2), the code attempts to re-read data into the previously allocated buffer 'b'. The buffer 'b' was allocated with 'size' bytes based on the original 'off'. However, the re-read operation uses 'off - 8' as the starting offset in the source buffer 'buf' while still attempting to read 'size' bytes into 'b'. This means the 'r_buf_read_at' function will attempt to write 8 bytes beyond the allocated boundary of 'b', leading to a heap buffer overflow."
