"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet demonstrates robust error handling and resource management. Memory allocations are checked, and corresponding kfree calls are made on all error paths using goto statements, preventing memory leaks, use-after-free, and double-free issues. No other obvious vulnerabilities like integer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or race conditions are present within this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles memory allocation and deallocation. It uses kzalloc and kmalloc for memory allocation and kfree for deallocation. Error conditions during memory allocation or other operations are handled by returning -ENOMEM or -EINVAL and jumping to appropriate cleanup labels (fail_rx, fail_eps) to free previously allocated resources, preventing memory leaks. There are no apparent buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free, or other common vulnerabilities within this snippet."
