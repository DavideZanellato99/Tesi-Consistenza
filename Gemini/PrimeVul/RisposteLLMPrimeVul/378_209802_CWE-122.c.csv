"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other vulnerabilities.","The code performs arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) on the 'lnum' variable, which represents a line number. The 'lnum' variable is of type 'linenr_T' (typically a signed long). There are no explicit checks to ensure that 'lnum' remains within the valid range of line numbers (0 to MAXLNUM) after these operations. If 'lnum' becomes negative due to underflow or exceeds MAXLNUM due to overflow, it can lead to incorrect line number calculations. This invalid line number, when returned and subsequently used by other parts of the program, could result in out-of-bounds memory access, leading to crashes, denial of service, or potentially exploitable conditions."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or in other security-critical contexts.","The code performs arithmetic operations (subtraction and addition) on the `lnum` variable, which is of type `linenr_T` (typically a long integer), using the `n` variable (also a long integer). There are no explicit bounds checks to prevent `lnum` from overflowing or underflowing its maximum or minimum representable value. If `lnum` is near its type's boundary and `n` is sufficiently large, these operations can lead to an integer overflow or underflow. A resulting invalid line number could then be used in subsequent operations by the caller, potentially causing out-of-bounds memory access, crashes, or incorrect program behavior."
