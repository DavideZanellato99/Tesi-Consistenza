"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or information disclosure.","The code iterates through RTCP XR report blocks, parsing their headers and advancing a pointer (rb_hdr) based on the block's declared length (rb_len). The rb_len value is read directly from the network packet. While there's an initial check for the overall packet length, there's no check to ensure that advancing rb_hdr by rb_len + 1 32-bit words will keep it within the bounds of the original pkt buffer. An attacker can provide a maliciously large rb_len value, causing rb_hdr to point beyond the allocated buffer. In the subsequent loop iteration, rb_hdr will be dereferenced (e.g., to read rb_hdr->length or rb_hdr->bt), resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a denial of service (crash) or potentially information disclosure."
