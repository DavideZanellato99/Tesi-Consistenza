"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","The program accesses memory that has been freed. This can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses a raw pointer `network` without explicit lifetime management. While a null check `if (!network)` is present, it does not prevent a Use-After-Free vulnerability if `network` points to an object that has been deallocated before or during the function's execution. Dereferencing a dangling pointer (e.g., `network->service_path()`) leads to undefined behavior, which can result in crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."
