"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs operations on a shared resource in an order that can be influenced by an external actor, leading to a race condition. This can result in unexpected behavior, data corruption, or denial of service.","The code accesses and modifies the 'function_defs_' map without proper synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes). If 'AddFunctionDefHelper' is called concurrently by multiple threads, a race condition can occur. Specifically, if two threads attempt to add a new function with the same name simultaneously, both might find no existing entry, then both might attempt to insert their respective 'FunctionDefAndOpRegistration' objects into the map. This can lead to one function definition overwriting another, resulting in an inconsistent state where the intended function definition is lost or an unexpected 'InvalidArgument' error is returned due to the race. This violates data integrity and can lead to unpredictable behavior."
