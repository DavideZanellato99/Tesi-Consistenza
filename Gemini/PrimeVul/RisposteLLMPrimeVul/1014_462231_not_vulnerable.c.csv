"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The PUTVAL32H function writes 4 bytes to the provided buffer starting at the given position. It lacks any bounds checking to ensure that 'pos + 3' does not exceed the allocated size of 'buf'. This absence of validation can lead to an out-of-bounds write if an attacker controls 'pos' or if 'pos' is derived from untrusted input, potentially corrupting memory, causing a crash, or enabling arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function performs writes to buf[pos+0] through buf[pos+3] without any bounds checking. If the sum of 'pos' and 3 exceeds the allocated size of the 'buf' buffer, it will result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a buffer overflow. The function relies on the caller to ensure sufficient buffer size, making it vulnerable to misuse."
