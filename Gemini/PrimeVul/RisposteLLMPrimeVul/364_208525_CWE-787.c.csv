"1","True","CWE-94","Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')","The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from a separate data segment. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if the input is malicious.","The code allows a user to insert the result of an expression into the command line by typing Ctrl-R =. The `get_expr_register()` function is called to evaluate this user-provided expression. If the expression evaluation mechanism is not properly sandboxed or restricted, an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code or commands through a crafted expression. While there are checks to prevent recursive evaluation or evaluation during password input, these do not fully mitigate the risk of arbitrary code execution if the expression language itself is powerful and not restricted for this context."

"4","True","CWE-94","Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')","The product generates code based on input from a privileged actor, but it does not sufficiently control the generation of that code, which can lead to the introduction of malicious code.","The code calls `get_expr_register()` to insert the result of an expression into the command line. If the expression evaluated by `get_expr_register()` can be controlled by an attacker and the expression evaluation mechanism allows for arbitrary code execution or system command execution, this constitutes a code injection vulnerability. The snippet does not show the implementation of `get_expr_register()`, but the described functionality is a common vector for such attacks if not properly sandboxed or sanitized."
