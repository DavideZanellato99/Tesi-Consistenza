"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit in some cases.","The code dereferences the 'input_node' pointer without checking if it is null. If 'graph.GetNode(tensor_id.node())' returns a null pointer (e.g., if the node identified by 'tensor_id.node()' does not exist in the graph), then '*input_node' will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a program crash (denial of service)."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically causes a crash or exit, which may lead to a denial of service.","The code retrieves a NodeDef pointer using graph.GetNode(tensor_id.node()) but does not check if the returned pointer is null before dereferencing it with *input_node. If graph.GetNode() returns a null pointer (e.g., if the node identified by tensor_id.node() does not exist in the graph), dereferencing it will lead to a crash or undefined behavior."
