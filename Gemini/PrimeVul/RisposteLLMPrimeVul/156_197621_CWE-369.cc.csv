"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location outside of the bounds of the buffer.","The code accesses elements of input tensors (node_id_range_t, stats_summary_shape_t, stats_summary_indices_t, stats_summary_values_t) at fixed or derived indices without explicitly validating that the tensors have sufficient dimensions or elements. Specifically, node_id_range(0) and node_id_range(1) are accessed assuming at least two elements, stats_summary_shape(2) and stats_summary_shape(3) are accessed assuming at least four elements, stats_summary_indices(idx, 3) is accessed assuming at least four columns, and stats_summary_values(idx) is accessed assuming its size matches num_sparse_entries. If an attacker provides malformed input tensors with insufficient dimensions or elements, these accesses will result in out-of-bounds reads, leading to application crashes (Denial of Service) or potentially information disclosure. The DCHECK statements are only active in debug builds and do not provide protection in release builds."
