"1","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle an unusual or exceptional condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The function contains a DBUG_ASSERT(0) which is intended to prevent its execution, as indicated by the comment ""Should not be called"". In a release build, DBUG_ASSERT might be disabled or compiled out, allowing the function to execute and return &type_handler_varchar. This violates the intended program logic and could lead to incorrect type handling, data misinterpretation, or other logical errors if the returned type handler is used in an inappropriate context."

"3","True","CWE-696","Incorrect Behavior if Assertions are Disabled","The product relies on assertions to enforce security policies or to prevent unexpected behavior. If assertions are disabled (e.g., in a release build), the product may behave incorrectly or insecurely.","The function contains DBUG_ASSERT(0), indicating it should never be called. In release builds where DBUG_ASSERT might be disabled, this assertion is bypassed, allowing the function to return &type_handler_varchar.
