"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses a character `*s` from the input text as an index into `reg->map` or `reg->int_map` without any bounds checking. If the value of `*s` exceeds the allocated size of these arrays, it will result in an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. Additionally, if `reg->map` is NULL in the first branch, dereferencing it would cause a crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code accesses reg->map[*s] or reg->int_map[*s]. If UChar (the type of *s) can represent values greater than the maximum index of the reg->map or reg->int_map arrays, an out-of-bounds read will occur. This is a common vulnerability when character maps are sized for 8-bit characters (e.g., 256 elements) but are used with wider character types like unsigned short or wchar_t which can hold values up to 65535. An attacker could craft input text containing high-value characters to trigger this out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and subsequent use of the read value."
