"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The gen_assignment function contains highly complex and conditional logic for managing a stack pointer (s->sp) within the NODE_CALL and NODE_SCALL cases. Operations like push(), pop(), pop_n(), and direct assignments to s->sp are executed based on various input parameters (val, sp, rhs) and properties of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes (tree->car, tree->cdr->car, etc.). This intricate conditional flow makes it challenging to guarantee that the stack pointer always remains within valid bounds and that push and pop operations are perfectly balanced across all possible execution paths. An attacker capable of controlling the input AST (e.g., by providing specially crafted source code) could potentially exploit this complexity to create an imbalance in stack operations. This imbalance could cause s->sp to point to a memory location outside of its intended buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write or read. Such an out-of-bounds memory access can result in memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code performs complex and conditional stack manipulations using push, pop, and pop_n operations, where the number of elements to pop (n) is derived from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node. The intricate logic, especially within the NODE_CALL/NODE_SCALL case, involves multiple conditional pushes and pops. If the internal stack pointer (s->sp) is not adequately validated against buffer boundaries within the push/pop implementations, a maliciously crafted AST could lead to an imbalance in stack operations. This imbalance could cause s->sp to go out of bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds read or write, which can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
