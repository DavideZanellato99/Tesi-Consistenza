"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The function lsquic_qeh_settings passes unsigned integer parameters max_table_size, dyn_table_size, and max_risked_streams directly to lsqpack_enc_init without any prior validation or bounds checking. If an attacker can control these input values and provide excessively large numbers, the lsqpack_enc_init function might attempt to allocate a disproportionately large amount of memory or other resources based on these sizes. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting system memory or other critical resources, making the application or system unavailable to legitimate users."

"3","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that input. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and denial of service.","The function lsquic_qeh_settings passes max_table_size, dyn_table_size, and max_risked_streams directly to lsqpack_enc_init without any validation or bounds checking. If these unsigned integer inputs are controlled by an untrusted source, an attacker could provide excessively large values, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation within lsqpack_enc_init and causing a denial of service due to resource exhaustion."
