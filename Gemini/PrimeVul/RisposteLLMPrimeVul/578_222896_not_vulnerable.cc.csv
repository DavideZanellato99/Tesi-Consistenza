"1","True","CWE-665","Improper Initialization","The product initializes a resource with a value that is not expected or is not suitable for the resource's subsequent use.","The 'name_to_node' std::unordered_map is declared but explicitly commented as 'Empty' and is never populated with any data within the provided code snippet. Despite being empty, this map is subsequently passed as an argument to the 'FindInputFeatures' function. If 'FindInputFeatures' relies on this map containing relevant node definitions to correctly determine input features, passing an empty map will lead to incorrect logic, incomplete results, or potentially runtime errors such as crashes if the function attempts to access non-existent elements without proper checks. This represents an improper initialization of a data structure critical for a subsequent function call."
"2","True","CWE-665","Improper Initialization","The product initializes a resource with an incorrect or incomplete value, or it does not initialize the resource at all, but then the product later accesses the resource as if it had been properly initialized.","The 'name_to_node' std::unordered_map is declared but never populated with NodeDef objects. It is then passed as an argument to the 'FindInputFeatures' function. It is highly probable that 'FindInputFeatures' relies on this map to resolve input NodeDefs for the graph nodes. Since the map is empty, 'FindInputFeatures' will fail to find any input NodeDefs, leading to an incorrect or incomplete inference of input properties. This constitutes a logical error and improper initialization of a critical data structure, which can lead to incorrect program behavior, potentially causing denial of service, incorrect resource allocation, or other issues depending on how the inferred properties are subsequently used."
