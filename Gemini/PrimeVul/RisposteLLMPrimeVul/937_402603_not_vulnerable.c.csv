"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be controlled by an actor. This can lead to a denial of service or other undesirable impacts.","The size parameter, which determines the size of the allocated buffer and the amount of data to be received by recvmsg, is directly taken from the function arguments. If an attacker can control this size value, they can specify an excessively large value. This would lead to the allocation of a very large memory buffer and an attempt to read a huge amount of data from the socket. Such an action can exhaust system memory, consume excessive network bandwidth, and cause the recvmsg call to block for an extended period, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the application or the entire system."

"3","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates resources, but it does not restrict or account for the overall amount of resources that are used, consumed, or created. This can lead to a denial of service, or make it easier for an attacker to conduct other attacks.","The function allocates memory using malloc(size) where 'size' is an unvalidated parameter received from an untrusted source. An attacker can provide an excessively large value for 'size', leading to a denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion or program termination (exit(1)) if the allocation fails. While only a small portion of the buffer is subsequently read, the large allocation itself is the vulnerability."
