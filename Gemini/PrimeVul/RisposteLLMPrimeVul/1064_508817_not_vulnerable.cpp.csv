"1","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software contains a recursive function or method that does not sufficiently limit the depth of recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow or other resource exhaustion.","The function recursively calls itself for each node in the 'slave' linked list. If the 'slave' list is excessively long, this recursive approach can lead to a stack overflow, causing a denial of service or program termination. An attacker might exploit this by providing input that constructs an extremely long 'slave' list, exhausting available stack memory."
"2","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","Uncontrolled recursion occurs when a recursive function does not sufficiently limit the number of times it calls itself. If the recursion depth is not properly controlled, an attacker may be able to provide specially crafted input that causes the function to recurse excessively, leading to a stack overflow and a denial of service.","The function recursively calls itself on 'slave' nodes. If the 'slave' structure forms a cycle, this will lead to uncontrolled recursion, causing a stack overflow and a denial of service. The code does not implement any cycle detection or recursion depth limit to prevent this."
