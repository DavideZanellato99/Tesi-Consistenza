"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication or the sum of an integer addition exceeds the maximum value for the integer type, resulting in an incorrect, smaller value. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The code performs multiplications and additions on int64_t variables (output_size and total_output_size) without checking for potential integer overflows. If the product or sum of these operations exceeds INT64_MAX, the values will wrap around, leading to incorrect calculations. An attacker controlling the input dimensions could exploit this to cause logical errors or potentially lead to further vulnerabilities if the calculated size is subsequently used for memory allocation or other security-sensitive operations."
