"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be greater than or equal to the original number. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The calculation of nsize as (nhashmask + 1) * sizeof(struct hlist_head) is susceptible to an integer overflow. If nhashmask is sufficiently large (e.g., UINT_MAX), nhashmask + 1 will wrap around to zero, resulting in nsize being zero. This can lead to an undersized memory allocation for ndst. Subsequent operations, such as xfrm_dst_hash_transfer, which attempt to populate this buffer, could then cause a heap-based buffer overflow by writing beyond the allocated memory."
