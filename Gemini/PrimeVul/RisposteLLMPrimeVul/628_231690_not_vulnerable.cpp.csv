"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which might be controlled by an actor. This can lead to a denial of service.","The code processes the 'reasonPhrase' field from a ConnectionCloseFrame without explicit size validation or rate limiting. An attacker could send multiple ConnectionCloseFrames with large reasonPhrase values, leading to excessive memory allocation for logging and storing error messages, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) through resource exhaustion."

"4","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle exceptional conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or a system crash. This often occurs when a program makes assumptions about the state of data or resources that are not always true, and fails to validate these assumptions before proceeding. An attacker might be able to trigger these unhandled conditions by providing unexpected input or by manipulating the program's environment, leading to a denial of service or other security impacts.","The code utilizes `CHECK` macros (e.g., CHECK_EQ, CHECK) which are assertions that terminate the program if their conditions are false. In a network-facing function processing untrusted input, an attacker could potentially craft malicious data to violate an internal invariant, thereby triggering a `CHECK` and causing the server process to crash. This constitutes a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, as a single malformed packet could lead to server unavailability. Production-grade code should handle such exceptional conditions gracefully, for instance, by logging an error and dropping the offending packet or connection, rather than aborting the entire application."
