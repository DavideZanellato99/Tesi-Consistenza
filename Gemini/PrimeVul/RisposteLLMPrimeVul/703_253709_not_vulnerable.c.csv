"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code calculates wa->nents using sg_nents_for_len(sg, len). This value is then passed as the nents argument to dma_map_sg. If the provided sg scatterlist is malformed (e.g., not properly terminated with SG_LAST or containing a loop via sg_next), sg_nents_for_len could return an excessively large number. This large number, when used in dma_map_sg, would cause an out-of-bounds read as dma_map_sg attempts to access scatterlist entries beyond the actual allocated size of the sg array. This can lead to a kernel crash (denial of service) or information disclosure."
