"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The 'port' argument is not explicitly validated to ensure it falls within the expected range of valid port numbers (1-65535). Providing an out-of-range value (e.g., negative or excessively large) could lead to 'htons' wrapping or truncating the value, causing the socket to bind to an unintended or unexpected port. This could potentially bypass firewall rules, make the service inaccessible at its intended location, or cause other unexpected behavior if an attacker can control the input 'port'."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. This can lead to a variety of weaknesses, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and SQL injection.","The code does not validate the 'port' parameter. If a negative value or a value greater than 65535 is provided, 'htons()' will truncate or wrap the value, potentially causing the socket to bind to an unintended port (e.g., 0 or 65535) instead of the expected one. This can lead to unexpected application behavior or a denial of service."
