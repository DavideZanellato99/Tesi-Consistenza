"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The code performs an unchecked downcast from a generic GF_Box pointer to a more specific GF_MovieFragmentRandomAccessOffsetBox pointer. If the s parameter does not actually point to an object of type GF_MovieFragmentRandomAccessOffsetBox, then the subsequent dereference ptr->container_size will result in a type confusion, leading to an out-of-bounds write or a write to an unintended memory location."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously initialized to NULL, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code does not perform null checks on the input pointers 's' and 'bs'. If 's' is null, 'ptr' will be null, leading to a null pointer dereference when accessing 'ptr->container_size' or within the ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE macro. If 'bs' is null, passing it to 'gf_bs_read_u32' will result in a null pointer dereference. Both scenarios can lead to a program crash or denial of service."
