"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code accesses query[1] in two conditions (if (query[0] == '*' && query[1] == '/') and if (query[0] == '/' && query[1] == '*')) without ensuring that query points to at least two characters. If query points to the last character of a string, accessing query[1] will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code performs out-of-bounds reads when checking for multi-character sequences like ""/*"" or ""*/"". Specifically, `query[1]` is accessed without ensuring that `query` points to at least two characters, leading to a read past the end of the string if `query` points to a single character or the null terminator. For example, if `query` points to the string ""/"" or ""*"" (when `comment` is true), accessing `query[1]` will result in an out-of-bounds read."
