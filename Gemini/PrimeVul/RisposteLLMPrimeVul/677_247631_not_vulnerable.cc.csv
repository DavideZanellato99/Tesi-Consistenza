"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a test case setup for an SslSocketTest. It defines TLS context configurations using hardcoded YAML strings and file paths for test certificates and keys. The code itself does not perform any operations that introduce security vulnerabilities such as improper input handling, memory corruption, or insecure cryptographic practices. It merely sets up test data and calls a test utility function with predefined expected values. Any potential vulnerabilities would reside in the underlying SslSocket implementation or the test utility function being called, not in this test setup code."

It sets up a scenario to test certificate digest and serial number retrieval. This code itself does not contain any direct security vulnerabilities as it is a test setup and does not process untrusted input, perform sensitive operations, or exhibit common programming errors that lead to vulnerabilities. Potential vulnerabilities would reside in the underlying TLS implementation being tested, not in this test configuration."
