"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function increments the pointers `*out`, `*inp1`, `*inp2`, and `*inp3` without performing any bounds checking. If these pointers are already at the end of their respective allocated memory regions, incrementing them will cause them to point past the end of the buffer. Subsequent dereferences of these incremented pointers would result in out-of-bounds memory access, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential memory corruption."

"4","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically leads to a crash or exit, but can sometimes be used to execute arbitrary code.","The function dereferences multiple pointers (out, inp1, inp2, inp3, and the pointers they point to, *out, *inp1, *inp2, *inp3) without checking if they are null. If any of these pointers are null, a null pointer dereference will occur, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
