"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.","The code directly assigns the step parameter to mouse_hor_step without any validation. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to provide arbitrary long values, including extremely large positive or negative numbers. Such values could lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service (e.g., an unresponsive user interface due to excessive scrolling), or potentially trigger other vulnerabilities in downstream code that uses mouse_hor_step without further checks."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this condition. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.","The function directly assigns the 'long' parameter 'step' to the 'mouse_hor_step' variable without any bounds checking or type validation. If 'mouse_hor_step' is a smaller integer type (e.g., 'int', 'short', 'char'), this direct assignment can lead to an integer overflow or truncation error if the value of 'step' exceeds the maximum or minimum representable value for 'mouse_hor_step'. This could result in unexpected behavior, incorrect scroll step values, or potentially lead to further vulnerabilities if the truncated value is used in security-sensitive calculations."
