"1","True","CWE-704","Improper Handling of Specific Data Types","The product receives or processes data of a specific type, but it does not handle that type correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or other vulnerabilities.","The function contains a logical error where the R_BIN_WASM_VALUETYPE_i64 enum value incorrectly returns the string ""i62"" instead of the expected ""i64"". This incorrect type representation could lead to downstream components misinterpreting the data type, potentially causing memory safety issues like buffer overflows or underflows, or other logical errors if the string is used for parsing, allocation, or security-sensitive decisions."

"3","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that results in an incorrect value. This can lead to various issues depending on the context and usage of the incorrect value, potentially impacting data integrity, system behavior, or security-critical decisions.","The function incorrectly returns the string ""i62"" instead of ""i64"" for the R_BIN_WASM_VALUETYPE_i64 case. This logical error can lead to incorrect data interpretation or processing in downstream components, potentially causing issues such as incorrect memory allocation, type confusion, or other misbehaviors if the string representation is used in security-sensitive operations or data handling."
