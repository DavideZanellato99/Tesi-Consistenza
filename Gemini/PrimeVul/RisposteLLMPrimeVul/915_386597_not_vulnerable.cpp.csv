"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.","The function directly passes floating-point data (data.x, data.y, data.z) to a writer method (dw.dxfReal) without any prior validation. If these values originate from an untrusted source and contain malformed or extreme floating-point numbers (e.g., NaN, infinity, very large/small values), the downstream writer or parser might mishandle them, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or denial of service."
