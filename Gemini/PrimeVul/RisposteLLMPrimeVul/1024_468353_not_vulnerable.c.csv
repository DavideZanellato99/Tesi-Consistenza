"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type. This can occur when a pointer or object is cast to an incorrect type, leading to operations that misinterpret the underlying data or memory structure. Such type confusion can result in crashes, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code casts a generic pointer (gpointer data) to a specific type (GCancellable *) without any runtime type checking or validation. If the data pointer does not actually point to a valid GCancellable object, or points to an object of a different type, calling g_cancellable_cancel on the incorrectly casted pointer can lead to type confusion, memory corruption, crashes (denial of service), or potentially arbitrary code execution. This is a classic type confusion vulnerability."
