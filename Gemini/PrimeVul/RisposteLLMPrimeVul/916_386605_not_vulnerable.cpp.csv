"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution if the overflowed value is used in security-critical operations like buffer size allocations or array indexing.","The code converts a string `groupValue` to an integer using `toInt()` based on `groupCode`. If `groupValue` is derived from untrusted input and `toInt()` does not perform robust range checking, an attacker could provide a string representing a number larger than the maximum value an integer can hold. This would lead to an integer overflow or wraparound, resulting in an unexpected or negative integer value. Such an incorrect value could then be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds memory access, or other security vulnerabilities."
