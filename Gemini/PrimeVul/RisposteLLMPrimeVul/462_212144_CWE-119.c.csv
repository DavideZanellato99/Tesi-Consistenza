"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.","The code calculates memory allocation size using (huff_rec_count - 1) * sizeof(*huffcdic->symbols). If huff_rec_count is sufficiently large, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller buffer being allocated by malloc. Subsequent operations in the loop that populate huffcdic->symbols could then write beyond the bounds of this undersized buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be robust and includes several checks to prevent common vulnerabilities. It validates input pointers (m->mh, m->mh->huff_rec_index, m->mh->huff_rec_count, curr), checks record counts against a maximum limit (HUFF_RECORD_MAXCNT), ensures a minimum number of records (huff_rec_count < 2), and verifies record sizes (curr->size < HUFF_RECORD_MINSIZE). The memory allocation for huffcdic->symbols is performed after ensuring huff_rec_count is at least 2, preventing underflow in the (huff_rec_count - 1) calculation. The result of malloc is checked for NULL. The loop for processing CDIC records correctly iterates within the allocated bounds and checks for NULL records. No obvious buffer overflows, integer overflows, or unhandled null pointer dereferences are present in this snippet."
