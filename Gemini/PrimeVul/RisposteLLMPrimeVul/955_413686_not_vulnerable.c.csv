"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet calls free() on a memory block derived using container_of(). If the memory block corresponding to the HintNode has already been deallocated prior to this call, executing free() again on the same address will result in a double free vulnerability, which can lead to heap corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet calls free() on a memory block derived using container_of(). If the memory block corresponding to the HintNode has already been deallocated prior to this call, executing free() again on the same address will result in a double free vulnerability, which can lead to heap corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
"3","True","CWE-763","Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference","The product attempts to release a pointer or reference that was not allocated by a corresponding allocation function, or was already released.","The function attempts to free memory derived from the input 'node' pointer using the 'container_of' macro. If 'node' is an invalid pointer (e.g., a dangling pointer, points to stack memory, or points to memory not allocated by malloc), or if it does not correctly point to an 'rb' member within a valid 'HintNode' structure, then 'container_of' will produce an invalid memory address. Passing an invalid address to 'free' results in undefined behavior, which can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or denial of service."
