"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The function accesses 'args[idx]' without performing any bounds checking on the 'idx' parameter. If 'idx' is controlled by an attacker or derived from untrusted input without proper validation, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing a crash (denial of service) or information disclosure from adjacent memory locations."
