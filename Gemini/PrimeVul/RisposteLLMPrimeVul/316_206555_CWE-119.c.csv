"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The function dynamicGetbuf copies rlen bytes into the caller-provided buffer buf using memcpy. The value of rlen is determined by the len parameter and the remaining data in dp->data. However, there is no check to ensure that the buf provided by the caller is actually large enough to hold len (or rlen) bytes. If an attacker can control the len parameter and provide a value larger than the actual allocated size of buf, a buffer overflow will occur when memcpy attempts to write beyond the bounds of buf."
