"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The 'code' parameter, which can be an untrusted input, is used as an index into the 'sgr_names' array without any bounds checking. If 'code' exceeds the valid index range of 'sgr_names', accessing 'sgr_names[code]' will result in reading memory outside the array's bounds, leading to a crash (Denial of Service) or potentially information disclosure. Furthermore, an integer overflow vulnerability exists where the 'param' variable can overflow if the 'test' string (derived from user-controlled 'value' via 'tgoto') contains a very long sequence of digits, potentially leading to logic errors. Another integer overflow can occur if 'code' is sufficiently large, causing '1 << (code - 1)' to overflow or result in undefined behavior."
