"1","True","CWE-77","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')","The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-controlled input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended command when it is executed.","The 'origin' variable is extracted from an untrusted Flatpak bundle file via 'flatpak_bundle_load'. This 'origin' string is then directly passed to 'flatpak_dir_create_origin_remote' to name a new remote. If this function or subsequent operations using the remote name do not properly sanitize or escape the 'origin' string before incorporating it into a shell command, an attacker could craft a malicious bundle to inject arbitrary commands, leading to arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. When input is not validated, an attacker may be able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the developer. This could lead to a range of issues including buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or other forms of code injection, as well as denial of service or information disclosure.","The 'origin' variable is extracted from the Flatpak bundle's metadata, which is an external and potentially untrusted source. This 'origin' string is then directly used as an argument to 'flatpak_dir_create_origin_remote' to name a new remote. If 'flatpak_dir_create_origin_remote' does not sufficiently validate or sanitize the 'origin' string, a malicious bundle could provide an 'origin' that conflicts with an existing, trusted remote name, potentially leading to an overwrite of the trusted remote's configuration (e.g., GPG keys), or creates a remote with a misleading name, which could confuse users. This constitutes improper input validation for data derived from an untrusted source used in a security-sensitive context."
