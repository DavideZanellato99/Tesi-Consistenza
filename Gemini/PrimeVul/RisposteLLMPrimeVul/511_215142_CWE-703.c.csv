"1","True","CWE-287","Improper Authentication","The product does not, or cannot, sufficiently authenticate a user or system.","The code initializes a 'secure channel' using dummy security policies and certificates, and directly sets its state to OPEN. If deployed in a production environment, this bypasses actual security mechanisms, leading to an insecure channel that appears secure, allowing unauthenticated or unauthorized access. The use of 'dummyPolicy', 'dummyCertificate', and direct state manipulation circumvents the proper establishment and verification of a secure communication channel."
"2","True","CWE-327","Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","The product uses a cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered strong or is inappropriate for the context, which could result in the exposure of sensitive information. This includes using algorithms with known weaknesses, insufficient key lengths, or improper modes of operation.","The code initializes a ""secure channel"" using dummy security policies and certificates, and directly sets its state to open. If this configuration is used in a production environment, it would result in a severely insecure communication channel because the dummy security parameters would not provide actual cryptographic protection, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, or impersonation. This setup bypasses proper security handshake procedures."
