"1","True","CWE-732","Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource","The product assigns permissions to a critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unauthorized actors.","The code explicitly sets the permissions of the TMATE_WORKDIR/sessions directory to 0703. This permission mode grants write access to 'others' (any user on the system) for this directory. This allows an unprivileged local attacker to create, rename, or delete files within the sessions directory, potentially leading to denial of service (e.g., by filling the directory or deleting critical session files), symlink attacks (if the application later opens files in this directory), or other forms of interference with legitimate sessions, which could result in information disclosure or privilege escalation if the application operates with elevated privileges."
"2","True","CWE-681","Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types","The product converts a string or other data type to a numeric type, but it does not correctly handle cases where the conversion is not possible or where the value is out of the expected range, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.","The code uses the `atoi()` function to convert command-line arguments into integer port numbers for `ssh_port`, `ssh_port_advertized`, and `websocket_port`. The `atoi()` function does not perform input validation. If a non-numeric string is provided as an argument, `atoi()` will return 0, potentially causing the application to bind to an unexpected or privileged port. If an extremely large number is provided, it could lead to integer overflow and undefined behavior, resulting in an incorrect port number being used. This lack of robust input validation can lead to denial of service, unexpected network behavior, or security misconfigurations."
