"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C/C++ code snippet has been carefully analyzed for common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free, null pointer dereferences, and format string vulnerabilities. The code uses RStrBuf for dynamic string manipulation, which generally prevents buffer overflows. Null pointer checks are performed for critical inputs and allocated resources. The R_FREE macro, commonly used in radare2, sets the pointer to NULL after freeing, which prevents double-free vulnerabilities that might otherwise arise from multiple R_FREE calls on the same pointer (e.g., type_fcn_name) across different execution paths or goto statements. No user-controlled format strings are used in r_strbuf_appendf calls, mitigating format string vulnerabilities. The logic for handling function arguments and their formatting, while complex, does not introduce any apparent security flaws."

"4","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A double free vulnerability occurs when a program calls free() twice on the same memory address. After the first free(), the memory region is added to the list of available memory. If the program attempts to free the same memory region again, it can lead to memory corruption, program crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the memory allocator's metadata.","The code snippet contains a double-free vulnerability. The variable type_fcn_name is allocated by r_type_func_guess. If r_type_func_guess returns a valid pointer but the subsequent check r_type_func_exist returns false, type_fcn_name is freed using R_FREE. Execution then proceeds to the beach label, where type_fcn_name is freed a second time, leading to a double-free condition. This can result in memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
