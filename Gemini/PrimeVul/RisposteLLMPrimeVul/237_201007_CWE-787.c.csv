"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code performs multiple pj_memcpy and pj_utoa operations to construct a string in the provided buffer buf. The initial length check is insufficient as it does not account for the variable length of m->desc.port, m->desc.port_count, the sum of m->desc.fmt[i].slen for all formats, and various fixed characters (spaces, slash, carriage return, newline). This allows an attacker to provide input data within the pjmedia_sdp_media structure that causes the pj_memcpy or pj_utoa calls to write beyond the allocated size of buf, resulting in a buffer overflow."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without sufficiently checking that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The initial buffer size check is incomplete as it does not account for the total length of all format strings (m->desc.fmt) that are subsequently copied into the buffer. The pj_memcpy calls within the loop iterating over m->desc.fmt elements do not perform bounds checking against the available buffer space, allowing an attacker to provide crafted input that causes data to be written beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution."
