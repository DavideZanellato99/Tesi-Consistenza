"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a straightforward data serialization function for writing DXF view information. It uses constant strings and integer values, and conditional logic based on a 'version' variable. There are no direct inputs from external sources, no complex memory operations, or any other patterns typically associated with common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or integer overflows. The code appears to be safe within the scope of this snippet, assuming the underlying 'DL_WriterA' methods are implemented securely."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a sequence of data writing operations using a DL_WriterA object. It does not process external input, perform memory operations, or exhibit any common vulnerability patterns within its scope. The operations involve writing constant strings, integers, and hex values based on an internal version check. No direct security vulnerabilities are apparent in this snippet."
