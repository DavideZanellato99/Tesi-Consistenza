"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles null input pointers and ensures proper memory management for intermediate image objects by calling gdImageDestroy. The angle normalization and conditional logic cover all possible angle ranges. While floating-point comparisons for exact angles might lead to minor functional differences due to precision, this does not constitute a security vulnerability. No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common security flaws are apparent in this snippet."

"4","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that produces an incorrect result.","The code uses direct equality comparisons with floating-point numbers (dAngle == 90.00, etc.). Due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic, these comparisons can fail even when the angle is mathematically equivalent, causing the code to bypass optimized rotation paths and instead execute a less efficient or potentially less precise sequence of operations. This constitutes an incorrect calculation in determining the optimal rotation strategy, which can lead to performance degradation or subtle image quality differences."
