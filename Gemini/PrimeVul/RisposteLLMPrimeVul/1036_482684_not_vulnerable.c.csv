"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles resource deallocation during state transitions. Specifically, in the GST_STATE_CHANGE_PAUSED_TO_READY transition, it checks if frame_data, delta_data, and converter pointers are non-NULL before freeing or destroying the associated resources and then sets the pointers to NULL. This pattern prevents double-free vulnerabilities and mitigates use-after-free issues within the scope of this function. No other obvious vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or unhandled memory leaks are present in the provided logic."
"2","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The program does not properly synchronize concurrent access to a shared resource. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or denial of service, and can often be exploited to achieve other vulnerabilities like use-after-free.","The code frees flxdec->frame_data and flxdec->delta_data during the GST_STATE_CHANGE_PAUSED_TO_READY transition. If these data members are accessed by another thread concurrently without proper synchronization, a race condition can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability."
