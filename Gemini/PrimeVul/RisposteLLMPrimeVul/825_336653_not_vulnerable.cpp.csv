"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates a memory address raw_caps and subsequent offsets for g_memdup based on fields (caps_offset, num_common_caps, num_channel_caps) from an untrusted SpiceLinkMess structure. Without proper validation of these fields against the actual size of the link_mess buffer, an attacker can craft a malicious link_mess to cause raw_caps or the subsequent read operations to go out of bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially more severe consequences."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code calculates a source pointer `raw_caps` and copy sizes based on attacker-controlled fields within the `SpiceLinkMess` structure (specifically `caps_offset`, `num_common_caps`, and `num_channel_caps`). There is no validation to ensure that `raw_caps` points to a valid memory region or that the total amount of data to be copied (derived from `num_common_caps` and `num_channel_caps`) fits within the bounds of the source buffer. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious `link_mess` structure to cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially disclosing sensitive information or leading to a denial of service. Additionally, integer overflows in the size calculations could lead to smaller memory allocations, resulting in heap buffer overflows during the `g_memdup` operations."
