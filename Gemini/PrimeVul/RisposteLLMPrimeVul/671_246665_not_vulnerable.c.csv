"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code accesses ctx->avc_state->sps[svcc->id] without validating that svcc->id is within the bounds of the sps array. If svcc->id is derived from untrusted input, an attacker could provide a crafted value for svcc->id that is out of the array's bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read when members of sps are accessed. This can result in denial of service or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product accesses or dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but that has been set to NULL. This typically causes a program crash or exit, which can be used to trigger a denial of service.","The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. Inside the if (ctx->codecid==GF_CODECID_AVC) block, the ctx->avc_state pointer is dereferenced without a prior check for NULL. If ctx->avc_state is NULL, accessing ctx->avc_state->sps will lead to a crash. Additionally, svcc->id is used as an index into the sps array without bounds checking, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read if svcc->id is controlled by an attacker."
