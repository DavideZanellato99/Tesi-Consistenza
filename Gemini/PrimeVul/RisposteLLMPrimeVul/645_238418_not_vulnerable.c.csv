"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","A buffer overflow condition that results in writing past the end of an intended buffer.","The code snippet performs direct array access using regs[regno] without validating that regno is within the bounds of the regs array. If regno can be controlled by an attacker or can otherwise exceed the allocated size of the regs array, this will lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory or leading to arbitrary code execution."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function mark_btf_ld_reg accesses the regs array at index regno without performing any bounds checking. If regno is an out-of-bounds index, it can lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory, causing a crash, or enabling arbitrary code execution."
