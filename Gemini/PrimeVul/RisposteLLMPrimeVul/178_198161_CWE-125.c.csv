"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the calculation is performed in a greater or equal width signed or unsigned integer type than the width of the result, which can lead to resultant information being used in a way that is not intended by the developer.","The code contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the `size` variable within the `switch (MATLAB_HDR.NameFlag)` block. The expression `(size + 3 + 1)` can overflow if the initial `size` value (read from the image blob as an unsigned integer) is sufficiently large and `size_t` is a 32-bit type. This overflow causes the `size` variable to wrap around to a small value (e.g., 0), leading to an incorrect seek operation (`SeekBlob(image2, size, SEEK_CUR)`). This misaligns the file pointer, causing subsequent reads to parse incorrect data, which can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or further memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows if misparsed sizes are used for allocations."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code reads the number of frames (Frames variable) directly from the input image data without any validation or limits. Specifically, in the case of a 4D matrix animation (DimFlag == 16), the value for 'Frames' is read using ReadBlobXXXLong(image2). If an attacker provides a very large value for 'Frames', the subsequent loop (controlled by 'if(--Frames>0) goto NEXT_FRAME;') will execute an excessive number of times. Each iteration of this loop involves repeated memory allocations (e.g., AcquireQuantumMemory for BImgBuff), image processing, and I/O operations. This uncontrolled loop will exhaust system resources such as memory and CPU, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application."
