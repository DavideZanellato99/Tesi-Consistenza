"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, leading to a memory leak. This can occur with various types of resources, including memory, file handles, or network connections. Over time, the accumulation of unreleased resources can lead to system instability, denial of service, or other adverse effects.","The code fails to release the reference count of struct page objects obtained via read_mapping_page. Each call to read_mapping_page increments the page's reference count, but there is no corresponding put_page() call in any execution path (including error paths or normal exits). This leads to a persistent increase in the reference count of pages, preventing them from being freed and eventually causing memory exhaustion or system instability."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to an incorrect calculation of the 'end' pointer. In the 'else' branch where 'end' is calculated as 'pptr + ((size + 31) & (PAGE_CACHE_BITS - 1)) / 32', if 'size' is slightly less than a multiple of 'PAGE_CACHE_BITS' (e.g., 'size = PAGE_CACHE_BITS - 1'), the expression '(size + 31) & (PAGE_CACHE_BITS - 1)' can incorrectly evaluate to a small value (e.g., 30), causing 'end' to be 'pptr + 0'. If a free block is found and allocated, the code proceeds to write to '*curr++' and then potentially '*curr' again at the 'last:' label. If 'curr' has advanced to 'pptr + 1' while 'end' is 'pptr + 0', this results in an out-of-bounds write to 'pptr[1]', which is outside the intended buffer for the current page. This can lead to memory corruption, system instability, or arbitrary code execution."
