"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid memory address (NULL). This typically leads to a crash or denial of service, but in some cases, it can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.","The code initializes 'view' using 'flatview_new(mr)' but does not check if 'view' is NULL before subsequent dereferences. If 'flatview_new' returns NULL (e.g., due to memory allocation failure or if 'mr' is NULL and 'flatview_new' handles it by returning NULL), operations like 'flatview_simplify(view)', 'view->dispatch = ...', and accessing 'view->nr' will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid object or memory address, typically resulting in a crash or denial of service. This can happen if a function returns NULL to indicate an error or an invalid state, and the calling code does not check for this NULL return value before attempting to dereference the pointer.","The code does not check if the FlatView pointer 'view' is NULL after the call to flatview_new(mr). If flatview_new returns NULL due to memory allocation failure or an invalid input 'mr', subsequent dereferences of 'view' such as 'view->dispatch' and 'view->nr' will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or denial of service."
