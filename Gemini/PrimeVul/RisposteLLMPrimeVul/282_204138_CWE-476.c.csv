"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or information disclosure.","The code pushes two bytes into a FIFO buffer and then attempts to pop two bytes using fifo8_pop_buf, which returns the actual number of bytes popped in the 'n' variable. However, the subsequent call to s->dma_memory_write uses a hardcoded size of 2 bytes instead of the 'n' variable. If, due to unexpected conditions or race conditions, fewer than 2 bytes are actually popped (i.e., n < 2), then s->dma_memory_write will attempt to read beyond the bounds of the buffer returned by fifo8_pop_buf, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code calls fifo8_pop_buf to retrieve 2 bytes from a FIFO but does not check the actual number of bytes returned in the 'n' parameter. If fifo8_pop_buf returns fewer than 2 bytes, the subsequent call to s->dma_memory_write will attempt to read 2 bytes from a buffer that may be undersized, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
