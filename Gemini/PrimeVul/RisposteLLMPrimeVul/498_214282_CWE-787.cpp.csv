"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which might be exploited to consume an excessive amount of resources and cause a denial of service.","The code reads the number_of_classes field directly from the input buffer as a 16-bit unsigned integer. This value, which can be up to 65535, dictates the number of iterations in a loop. Inside this loop, memory is allocated for each inner class entry and appended to a list. If an attacker provides a crafted input with a large number_of_classes, the function will attempt to allocate a significant amount of memory and perform numerous list operations, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource. This can lead to a denial of service or other undesirable system behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to uncontrolled resource consumption. The 'number_of_classes' field, read directly from the input buffer as a USHORT, dictates the number of iterations in a loop. A malicious actor can craft input where 'number_of_classes' is set to its maximum value (65535). This would cause the loop to execute 65535 times, leading to excessive memory allocations (for RBinJavaClassesAttribute structs and list nodes) and CPU consumption, potentially exhausting system resources and causing the application to become unresponsive or crash."
