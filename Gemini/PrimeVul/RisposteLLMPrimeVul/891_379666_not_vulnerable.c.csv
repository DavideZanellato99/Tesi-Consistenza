"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function does not validate the input 'name' pointer. If 'name' is a NULL pointer or an empty string, dereferencing '*name' will lead to a null pointer dereference or an out-of-bounds read, causing a crash or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function r_anal_var_check_name dereferences the name pointer using *name without checking if name is NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed as the name argument, the application will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault and application crash."
