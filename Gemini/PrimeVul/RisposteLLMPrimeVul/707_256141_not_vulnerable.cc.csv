"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs pointer arithmetic on *inp and *out by adding kNumOperands without any bounds checking. If the memory regions pointed to by *inp or *out are not large enough to accommodate this advancement and subsequent LOAD/STORE operations, it will lead to out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in potential data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function performs pointer arithmetic and memory access without validating that the input and output pointers point to sufficiently large and valid memory buffers. This lack of bounds checking can lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities if an attacker provides crafted input, potentially resulting in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
