"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses ji->active_ag as an index into the bmap->db_active array without explicit bounds checking. If ji->active_ag can be manipulated or become corrupted to a value outside the allocated bounds of the db_active array, the atomic_dec operation would result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption, system instability, or a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-703","Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The code contains a BUG_ON assertion. If the condition !list_empty(&ji->anon_inode_list) evaluates to true, the kernel will panic, leading to a Denial of Service. An attacker who can manipulate the inode state to make ji->anon_inode_list non-empty during eviction could trigger this panic, causing the system to crash."
