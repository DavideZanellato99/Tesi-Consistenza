"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The fixed-size buffer 'key' is populated by the 'make_key' function. If 'make_key' does not correctly validate the total length of the data it writes against the provided buffer size (sizeof(key)), it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The return value of the make_key function, assigned to keylen, is not validated against the actual size of the key buffer (sizeof(key)). If make_key returns a keylen value greater than MAX_MAILBOX_PATH+1, subsequent calls to read_old_value, cyrusdb_delete, and cyrusdb_store will use this oversized length when accessing the key buffer. This will result in an out-of-bounds read from the key buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure, application crashes, or other undefined behavior."
