"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The function check_for_opt_chan_or_job_arg accesses args[idx] without performing any bounds checking on the idx parameter. If idx can be controlled by an attacker and exceeds the allocated size of the args array, it will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or information disclosure. The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation for the idx parameter before array access."
