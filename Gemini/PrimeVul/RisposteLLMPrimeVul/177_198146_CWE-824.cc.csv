"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The loop iterates from 'node_id_first' to 'node_id_last', where these values are directly taken from user-controlled input 'node_id_range'. If 'node_id_last' exceeds the actual size of the first dimension of the 'stats_summary' tensor, accessing 'stats_summary(node_id, 0, 0, 0)' will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or a crash."
