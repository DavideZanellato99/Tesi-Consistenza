"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product performs operations on a heap-based buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.","The getcmdline_int function processes user input and modifies a global command-line buffer (ccline.cmdbuff) through helper functions like put_on_cmdline, cmdline_paste, and bracketed_paste. If these helper functions do not correctly reallocate ccline.cmdbuff or perform sufficient bounds checking when inserting user-controlled data, a heap-based buffer overflow could occur. An attacker could provide a specially crafted long input string, for example, via bracketed paste, causing data to be written beyond the allocated memory region of ccline.cmdbuff, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The provided snippet itself does not contain the implementation of these helper functions, but it calls them, making it a point where such a vulnerability could be triggered."
