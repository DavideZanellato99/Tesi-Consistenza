"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This typically occurs when a fixed-size buffer is used as the destination for a copy operation, and the size of the data to be copied is not adequately checked against the destination buffer's capacity.","The function copies data into the 'data' buffer using memcpy. The 'count' parameter, which determines the total amount of data to be copied, is not validated against the actual size of the 'data' buffer provided by the caller. If 'count' is larger than the allocated size of 'data', an out-of-bounds write will occur, leading to a buffer overflow."
