"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code writes data from 'ptr->data' using 'ptr->data_length' as the size. If 'ptr->data_length' is controlled by an attacker and exceeds the actual allocated size of 'ptr->data', an out-of-bounds read will occur when 'gf_bs_write_data' attempts to access memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to information disclosure or a denial of service."
