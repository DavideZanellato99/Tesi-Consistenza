"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than the maximum size that can be stored in the available memory, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other unexpected behavior.","The code calculates a time increment 'inc' using unsigned 64-bit integers. The multiplication 'inc *= ctx->timescale' (effectively 'ctx->cur_fps.den * ctx->timescale') can lead to an integer overflow if the product exceeds the maximum value representable by a 'u64'. If an overflow occurs, 'inc' will wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value, resulting in erroneous time calculations for 'ctx->cts' and 'ctx->dts'. This could lead to denial of service or unexpected application behavior due to incorrect time synchronization."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an addition, multiplication, or subtraction operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be stored in the associated data type, leading to a wraparound to an incorrect value.","The calculation of the time increment `inc` involves a multiplication `inc *= ctx->timescale;` where `inc` is an unsigned 64-bit integer. If `ctx->cur_fps.den` (assigned to `inc`) and `ctx->timescale` are both sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum value for a `u64`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow would cause `inc` to wrap around to an incorrect, smaller value, resulting in `ctx->cts` and `ctx->dts` being updated with an erroneous time increment, potentially causing media desynchronization or other playback issues."
