"1","True","CWE-843","Type Confusion","Type confusion occurs when a program accesses a resource with a type that is different from the type that was intended or assumed by the programmer. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes, or other unexpected behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.","The code performs an unchecked downcast from GF_Box* to GF_ProjectionTypeBox*. If the input pointer 's' does not actually point to a GF_ProjectionTypeBox or a compatible structure, accessing members like 'ptr->type' or other fields could lead to type confusion, resulting in out-of-bounds reads, arbitrary memory access, or a crash."

"3","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource, which can lead to type confusion. This can occur when a pointer to an object of one type is cast to a pointer to an object of a different, incompatible type, and then members of the incorrectly typed object are accessed. Such access can result in out-of-bounds reads or writes, leading to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code performs an unchecked cast from a generic GF_Box pointer to a GF_ProjectionTypeBox pointer. If the input GF_Box pointer 's' does not actually point to a GF_ProjectionTypeBox or a compatible structure, accessing members like 'ptr->type', 'ptr->layout', or 'ptr->bounds_top' could lead to type confusion and out-of-bounds reads, potentially causing crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior. There is no validation to ensure the correct type before the cast and subsequent member access."
