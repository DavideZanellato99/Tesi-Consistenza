"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code fails to validate that group_id and slot_id are non-negative before using them as array indices for info->mem_slots. The checks group_id > info->num_memslots_groups and slot_id > info->num_memslots only prevent positive out-of-bounds access, leaving the code vulnerable to negative index access. If either group_id or slot_id is a negative value, the access info->mem_slots[group_id][slot_id] will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses group_id and slot_id as array indices without checking for negative values.
