"1","True","CWE-208","Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy","The product exposes sensitive information by responding differently to inputs that vary only in the time required to process them. This can allow an attacker to deduce information about the sensitive data by carefully measuring the response times.","The code uses strncmp to compare password hashes in both the PBKDF2 and non-PBKDF2 branches. The strncmp function is not constant-time, meaning its execution time can vary depending on the position of the first differing byte between the two strings being compared. This timing discrepancy can be exploited by an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack, revealing information about the password hash one byte at a time, which can significantly aid in brute-forcing or guessing the hash."
"2","True","CWE-208","Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy","The product exposes sensitive information by responding differently to inputs at different times, which can allow an attacker to deduce the value of the sensitive information.","The code uses strncmp to compare sensitive cryptographic values (password hashes/keys). This function is not constant-time and can leak information about the stored secret through timing side-channel attacks, allowing an attacker to deduce the password hash/key byte by byte."
