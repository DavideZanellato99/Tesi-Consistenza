"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not sufficiently control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code snippet processes a list of tables and recursively processes sub-queries, adding table pointers to a list (leaf_tables_prep). An attacker could craft a complex query with a large number of tables or deeply nested sub-queries, leading to excessive memory allocation via the leaf_tables_prep.push_back() calls. Although the function attempts to propagate errors by returning TRUE if push_back fails, this does not prevent the underlying resource exhaustion, which can lead to a Denial of Service."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C++ code snippet iterates through a list of tables and attempts to add them to another list. The `push_back` operation includes error handling for potential memory allocation failures, returning TRUE if an error occurs. There are no apparent buffer overflows, use-after-frees, integer overflows, or other common security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The code appears to handle resource allocation failures gracefully."
