"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","A null pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been initialized or has been set to NULL, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.","The function does not check if the 'parent' pointer is NULL before dereferencing it to access 'parent->node_head'. If 'parent' is NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a program crash or denial of service."
