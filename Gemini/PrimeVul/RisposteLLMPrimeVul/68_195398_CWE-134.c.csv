"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string that is derived from untrusted input. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The code uses snprintf(cap->card, labellen, dev->card_label); where dev->card_label is directly passed as the format string. If dev->card_label can be controlled by an attacker (e.g., through a module parameter), an attacker could inject format string specifiers (like %x, %p, %n) into dev->card_label. This could lead to information disclosure (leaking kernel memory), denial of service (kernel crash), or potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel context."
