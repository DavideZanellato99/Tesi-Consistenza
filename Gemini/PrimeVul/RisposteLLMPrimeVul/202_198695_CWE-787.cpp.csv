"1","True","CWE-120","Classic Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overrun the output buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The `header->ordnum` field is read from the input file as a 16-bit unsigned integer. This value is then used as the upper bound for a loop that copies data from a dynamically allocated buffer (`orders`) into `header->ord`. If `header->ord` is a fixed-size array within the `TXMHeader` structure and the file-controlled `header->ordnum` exceeds its actual capacity, data will be written out of bounds. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the `strcpy(header->tracker, ""Screamtracker 3"");` call is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if `header->tracker` is a fixed-size buffer smaller than 16 bytes, as the source string including the null terminator is 16 bytes long."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds writes. The 'header->ordnum' field, read from the input file, is used to control a loop that copies data into 'header->ord'. If 'header->ordnum' exceeds the fixed capacity of 'header->ord' (typically 256 bytes), a buffer overflow will occur. Additionally, the 'header->insnum' and 'header->patnum' fields, also read from the input file, are used as loop bounds for accessing 'module->instr', 'module->smp', and 'module->phead' arrays. If these file-provided counts exceed the pre-allocated capacities of these internal module arrays, out-of-bounds writes will occur, leading to data corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
