"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product performs a write operation on a memory location that is outside of the intended buffer's boundary.","The code allows input_min_tensor and input_max_tensor to have either 0 or 1 dimensions based on the OP_REQUIRES checks. However, in the 'if (axis_ == -1)' block, it unconditionally calls scalar<T>() on these tensors and their corresponding output backprop tensors (input_min_backprop, input_max_backprop). The scalar<T>() method is only valid for tensors with 0 dimensions. If an attacker provides input tensors with 1 dimension, the calls to scalar<T>() will attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated tensor, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write, which can cause a crash, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The code snippet has a vulnerability due to improper input validation. The input_min_tensor and input_max_tensor are initially validated to allow 0 dimensions (scalar) or 1 dimension. However, when axis_ is not -1, the code attempts to access dim_size(0) on these tensors. If either tensor is a scalar (0 dimensions), accessing dim_size(0) is an invalid operation, as scalar tensors do not have a dimension at index 0. This can lead to a runtime error such as an assertion failure, out-of-bounds read, or segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service."
