"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. If abbrev->count is 0, the expression abbrev->count - 1 will underflow (assuming abbrev->count is an unsigned type), resulting in a very large positive number. This causes the loop to iterate an excessive number of times, leading to an out-of-bounds write when accessing die->attr_values[i] without proper bounds checking against the allocated size of the array. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The loop iterates based on abbrev->count without validating that the index i remains within the bounds of the die->attr_values array. If abbrev->count is larger than the allocated size of die->attr_values, an attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds write via memset and subsequent assignments to die->attr_values[i], leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
