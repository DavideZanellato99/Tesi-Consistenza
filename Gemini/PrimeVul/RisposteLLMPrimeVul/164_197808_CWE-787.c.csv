"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","A program writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that is outside the bounds of the buffer. This can corrupt data, lead to a crash (denial of service), or allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code contains an out-of-bounds write and read vulnerability. In the argument shifting logic, specifically within the `else { /* n > 0 */ ... }` block, the loop `for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { regs[i] = regs[i+1]; }` reads `regs[n]` when `i` is `n-1`, which is one element beyond the valid bounds of the `regs` array (assuming `n` is the number of elements in the array `regs[0]` to `regs[n-1]`). Additionally, the subsequent lines `regs[n] = regs[n+1];` and `regs[n+1] = regs[n+2];` perform further out-of-bounds reads and writes on the stack. This can lead to data corruption, denial of service (crashes), or potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical stack data."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. In the argument shifting logic (when n is not 15), the loop `for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { regs[i] = regs[i+1]; }` reads `regs[n]` when `i` is `n-1`, which is beyond the allocated `n` elements for `regs`. Subsequently, `regs[n] = regs[n+1];` and potentially `regs[n+1] = regs[n+2];` perform further out-of-bounds reads and writes to the stack. This incorrect indexing and access beyond the bounds of the `regs` array can lead to stack corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
