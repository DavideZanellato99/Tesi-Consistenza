"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple C++ constructor that initializes its base class. It does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities such as memory allocation, input processing, or complex logic. Therefore, based on this snippet alone, no vulnerabilities are detected."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple C++ constructor that delegates to its base class constructor. It does not perform any operations that introduce security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, use-after-free, or improper input validation within its scope. The handling of the 'ctx' pointer is assumed to be managed by the framework and the base class constructor."
