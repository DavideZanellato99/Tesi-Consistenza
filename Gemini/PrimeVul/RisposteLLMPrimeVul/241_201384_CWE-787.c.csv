"1","True","CWE-835","Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')","The product contains a loop that does not terminate or does not terminate in a timely manner, which can lead to a denial of service. This can occur when the loop's exit condition is never met or when the condition depends on external factors that are not guaranteed to change.","The code processes multi-byte characters using `mb_ptr2char_adv` and `mb_ptr2char`. If these functions, when encountering a malformed multi-byte sequence, return a character length (`clen`) of zero and the character value `c` causes the `while` loop condition `c == mb_ptr2char(s)` to remain true, the pointer `s` will not advance. This would result in an infinite loop, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer is null-terminated or that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The function repeatedly appends data to a garray_T buffer using ga_concat and ga_concat_esc within a loop that processes an input string of arbitrary length. If the garray_T buffer is fixed-size or if the ga_concat and ga_concat_esc functions do not correctly perform bounds checking and dynamic resizing, a long input string could lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory region. A secondary potential vulnerability exists with the vim_snprintf call, where the size NUMBUFLEN for the buf buffer is undefined. If NUMBUFLEN is too small and vim_snprintf does not guarantee truncation, it could also lead to a buffer overflow."
