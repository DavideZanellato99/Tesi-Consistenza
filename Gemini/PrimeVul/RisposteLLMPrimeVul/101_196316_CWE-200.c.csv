"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or information disclosure.","The function uses memcmp to compare an input buffer md with a computed digest tmp for len bytes. The value len is determined by digest_length(d). There is no check to ensure that the buffer pointed to by md is at least len bytes long. If an attacker can control the size of the buffer pointed to by md such that it is smaller than len, an out-of-bounds read will occur when memcmp attempts to read past the end of the md buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-208","Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy","The product exposes sensitive information to an attacker by allowing the attacker to measure the time it takes for certain operations to complete. This timing information can reveal details about the internal state or secret values used by the product.","The function uses memcmp to compare a cryptographic digest. Standard memcmp implementations are not constant-time, meaning their execution time can vary depending on the position of the first differing byte. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker as a side channel to deduce information about the digest, making it vulnerable to a timing attack."
