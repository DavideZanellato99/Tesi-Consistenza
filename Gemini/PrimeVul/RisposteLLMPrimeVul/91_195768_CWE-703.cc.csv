This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory, eventually causing the program or system to crash or become unresponsive.","The code allocates a new QuantileStreamResource object using 'new'. If the subsequent call to CreateResource fails for any reason other than 'ALREADY_EXISTS', the allocated object is not properly deallocated, leading to a memory leak.
