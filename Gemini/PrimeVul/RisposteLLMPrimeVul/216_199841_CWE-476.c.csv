"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit of the product, or to an exploitable condition.","The code initializes obj to NULL. If the memory allocation for obj fails (R_NEW0 (RKernelCacheObj) returns NULL), the code frees prelink_range and then jumps to the beach error handling label. Inside the beach label, the statement obj->cache_buf = NULL; attempts to dereference obj which is still NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory address and is currently NULL. This typically leads to a crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited for arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. In the 'beach' error handling block, the line 'obj->cache_buf = NULL;' attempts to dereference 'obj' which can be NULL if memory allocation for 'obj' failed or if 'obj' was explicitly freed in an earlier error path before jumping to 'beach'. This will lead to a crash, causing a denial of service."
