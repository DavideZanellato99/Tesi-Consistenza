"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two or more numbers is calculated, and the result is larger or smaller than the maximum or minimum value that can be stored in the associated data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The code snippet contains several arithmetic operations involving line numbers and counts (e.g., df_lnum, df_count) that can lead to integer underflow or overflow. Specifically, calculations like 'dnext->df_lnum[i] = line1 + (dprev->df_lnum[i] + dprev->df_count[i]) - (dprev->df_lnum[idx] + dprev->df_count[idx]);' and subtractions from 'dp->df_count[idx]' (e.g., 'dp->df_count[idx] -= line2 - dp->df_lnum[idx] + 1;') do not check for boundary conditions. If the result of these operations falls outside the valid range for the 'linenr_T' or 'long' types (depending on their underlying signed/unsigned nature and size), it can wrap around to a very large positive or negative value. Such incorrect line numbers or counts could subsequently lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses (e.g., when indexing an array of lines or allocating memory), buffer overflows, or other unpredictable behavior, potentially resulting in crashes, data corruption, or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a certain size.
