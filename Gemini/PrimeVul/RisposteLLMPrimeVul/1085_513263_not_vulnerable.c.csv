"1","True","CWE-908","Use of Uninitialized Resource","The software uses a resource that has not been initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, incorrect calculations, or information disclosure.","The code attempts to prevent information disclosure by calling empty_record if create_internal_tmp_table fails, as indicated by the comment ""Make empty record so random data is not written to disk"". This pattern of explicitly clearing data on error paths is a common source of vulnerabilities (CWE-908) if the clearing function is incomplete or fails to cover all relevant uninitialized buffers within the table object. If empty_record does not fully sanitize all potentially sensitive uninitialized data, this could lead to information exposure if the table's contents are later written to disk."
"2","True","CWE-908","Use of Uninitialized Resource","The product uses a resource that has not been initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, information disclosure, or denial of service.","The code attempts to open a temporary table using open_tmp_table(table). If this call fails, the table object (passed by pointer) may be left in an uninitialized or partially initialized state. There is no explicit cleanup, such as calling empty_record(table), in this failure path to ensure the table's memory is zeroed or put into a safe state. If the caller subsequently accesses or exposes the contents of this uninitialized table object, it could lead to information disclosure from previous memory allocations."
