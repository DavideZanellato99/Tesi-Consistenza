"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code calculates posptr = ptr + pos->col; without validating pos->col against the actual length of the line. If pos->col is greater than the line's length, posptr will point out of bounds. The subsequent loop for (;;) continues to advance ptr and dereference *ptr until ptr reaches posptr. This allows ptr to read past the NUL terminator of the line into adjacent memory, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer or before the beginning of the buffer.","The code calculates posptr = ptr + pos->col; where pos->col is an offset. If pos->col is controlled by an attacker and is larger than the actual allocated size of the line buffer returned by ml_get_buf, posptr will point out of bounds. Subsequently, the loop iterates using ptr and reads *ptr in each step.
