"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code writes to compflags[sp->ts_complen] and compflags[sp->ts_complen + 1] without performing any bounds checking on the sp->ts_complen index against the allocated size of the compflags buffer. If sp->ts_complen can exceed the buffer's capacity, this will result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a buffer overflow. This could corrupt adjacent memory, cause a crash, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code writes to `compflags[sp->ts_complen]` and `compflags[sp->ts_complen + 1]` without performing any bounds checking on the `compflags` buffer. If the value of `sp->ts_complen` can exceed the allocated size of `compflags`, this will result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to corrupt memory, cause a denial of service, or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution."
