"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The function uses the 'afi' parameter as an array index without proper bounds checking. If 'afi' is an out-of-bounds value, it will lead to an out-of-bounds read from the 'bgp' structure, specifically from arrays like 'bgp->redist', 'bgp->redist_metric_flag', 'bgp->redist_metric', and 'bgp->rmap'. This can result in information leakage or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-119","Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer","The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. This can be caused by various issues, such as incorrect indexing, pointer arithmetic errors, or a failure to properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.","The code uses the vty_out function to print the string bgp->rmap[afi][i].name, which is likely user-controlled input. There are no explicit length checks on this string before it is passed to vty_out. If an attacker can provide an excessively long string for bgp->rmap[afi][i].name, it could lead to a buffer overflow within the vty_out function's internal buffer or the underlying output mechanism. This could result in a denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
