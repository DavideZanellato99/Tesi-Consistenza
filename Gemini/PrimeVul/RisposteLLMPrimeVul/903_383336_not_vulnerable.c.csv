"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically leads to a crash (denial of service) or potentially arbitrary code execution if the dereferenced memory can be controlled by an attacker.","The function gdImageRotate180 dereferences the input pointer `src` (e.g., `src->trueColor`, `src->sx`, `src->sy`) without checking if it is NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed as `src`, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash and a denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but could be NULL, which can cause a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The function does not validate if the input 'src' pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. If 'src' is NULL, accessing 'src->trueColor', 'src->sx', or 'src->sy' will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
