"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or allow the execution of arbitrary code.","The function __set_close_on_exec uses the 'fd' parameter as an index to set a bit within the 'fdt->close_on_exec' bit array via the __set_bit macro/function. There is no explicit bounds checking performed on 'fd' against the allocated size of 'fdt->close_on_exec'. If an attacker can supply an 'fd' value that exceeds the bounds of this array, it will result in an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting adjacent memory, leading to a denial of service, or enabling arbitrary code execution."
