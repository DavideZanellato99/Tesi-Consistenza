"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or corrupt data.","The `outstring` buffer is passed as an argument without its size. The function uses `strcpy` and `strcat` to write into this buffer. Although an internal length check (`outlen > INDX_INFLTAG_SIZEMAX`) exists, it only limits the total generated string length and does not prevent writing beyond the actual allocated size of the `outstring` buffer if the caller provides a buffer smaller than `INDX_INFLTAG_SIZEMAX`. This can lead to a buffer overflow."

"3","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function mobi_reconstruct_infl takes a char *outstring parameter without an associated size. It then uses strcpy and multiple strcat calls to write data into this buffer. While there is an internal check (outlen > INDX_INFLTAG_SIZEMAX) to limit the logical length of the generated string, this limit does not correspond to the actual allocated size of the outstring buffer provided by the caller. If the caller provides a buffer for outstring that is smaller than the data the function attempts to write, a buffer overflow will occur, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
