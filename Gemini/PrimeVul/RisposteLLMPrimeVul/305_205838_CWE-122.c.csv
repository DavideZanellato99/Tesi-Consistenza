"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are requested or consumed by an actor, which can be used to exhaust available resources.","The function get_one_sourceline dynamically grows a buffer to read lines. If an input line contains an escaped newline (a newline preceded by an odd number of Ctrl-V characters), the function continues reading and growing the buffer. An attacker can craft a malicious input file where every newline is escaped, forcing the buffer to continuously expand and consume excessive memory, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to uncontrolled resource consumption."
