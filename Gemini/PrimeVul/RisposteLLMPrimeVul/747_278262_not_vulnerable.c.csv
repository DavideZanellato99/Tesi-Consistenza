"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can occur when the software attempts to read from an index that is outside the valid range for the buffer, or when it reads a string that is not properly null-terminated. An out-of-bounds read can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates through the input string `ptr` using `for ( ; *ptr; ++ptr)` without any explicit bounds checking on the `ptr` buffer itself. If `ptr` does not point to a valid null-terminated string, or points to a buffer that is not null-terminated within its allocated size, the loop will read past the end of the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior. The `ptr2cells` function, if it reads multiple characters, could also exacerbate this issue."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The 'count' variable, which accumulates the visual width of leading whitespace, is an 'int'. If the input string contains an extremely large number of whitespace characters, the 'count' variable could overflow, leading to an incorrect calculation of the indent. This integer overflow could result in unexpected behavior, incorrect display, or if 'count' is subsequently used in memory allocation or indexing, it could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities."
