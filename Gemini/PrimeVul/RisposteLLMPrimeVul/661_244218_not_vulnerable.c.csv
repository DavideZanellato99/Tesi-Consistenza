"1","True","CWE-252","Unchecked Return Value","The product does not check the return value of a function call, which can lead to unexpected program behavior.","The function void_box_new uses the ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC macro to allocate memory. If this underlying memory allocation fails, the tmp pointer will be NULL. The function then returns this tmp pointer without any explicit check for NULL or error handling. This unchecked return value can lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the calling code if the caller does not validate the returned pointer, potentially causing a crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location. This typically leads to a crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The function void_box_new uses the ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC macro which likely performs memory allocation. If this allocation fails, the tmp pointer will be NULL. The function then returns this NULL pointer without any explicit check. A subsequent dereference of this NULL pointer by the caller would lead to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability, causing a crash or denial of service."
