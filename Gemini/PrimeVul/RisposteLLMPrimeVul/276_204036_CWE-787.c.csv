"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code reads a length value (fw.len) from a hardware register and uses it to determine the amount of data to download into the self->rpc buffer. There is no size validation to ensure fw.len does not exceed the allocated size of self->rpc. An attacker manipulating the hardware register or firmware response could provide an arbitrarily large fw.len, causing a buffer overflow when data is written beyond the bounds of self->rpc, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

"5","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code downloads data into `self->rpc` based on `fw.len` without proper bounds checking. If `fw.len`, which is derived from a hardware register value, can be controlled by an attacker or an untrusted source, an excessively large value could lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
