"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a buffer using an offset or index that is outside of the intended bounds of the buffer.","The function notify_action_open_archive_cb directly casts user_data to NotifyData* without validating if user_data points to a valid NotifyData structure. If an attacker can control the user_data argument, they can provide an arbitrary memory address. This allows the attacker to control the notify_data pointer. Subsequently, notify_data->window and window->priv->saving_file are dereferenced. If notify_data or window point to an attacker-controlled or invalid memory location, these dereferences will result in an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). The value obtained from window->priv->saving_file (which is arbitrary memory content) is then used as a file path in fr_window_archive_open, potentially leading to arbitrary file access, information disclosure, or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is used to access a file or directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that could cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the intended directory.","The code opens an archive using `fr_window_archive_open` with the path `window->priv->saving_file`. If `window->priv->saving_file` is derived from or influenced by untrusted input without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker could specify an arbitrary file path. This could lead to the application attempting to open sensitive system files, potentially causing information disclosure, denial of service, or other unintended behavior depending on the capabilities of `fr_window_archive_open`."
