"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be larger and it wraps to a smaller number. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The calculation `nr_files * sizeof(struct io_fixed_file)` can result in an integer overflow if `nr_files` is sufficiently large. If an overflow occurs, the `size` variable will hold a value smaller than the actual intended size. This incorrect `size` is then passed to `io_free_page_table`, which could lead to incorrect memory deallocation, heap corruption, or other memory-related vulnerabilities depending on how `io_free_page_table` uses this size parameter."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic does not properly anticipate and handle this condition.

If an overflow occurs, the `size` variable will hold an incorrect, smaller value. This underflowed size is then passed to `io_free_page_table`, which could lead to a partial deallocation and a memory leak, or other memory corruption issues depending on the custom free function's implementation."
