"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or in some cases, allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation. The 'facet' parameter, used as an array index for 'stl->facet_start' and 'stl->neighbors_start', is not checked to ensure it falls within valid bounds. An attacker providing an out-of-range 'facet' can cause an out-of-bounds read when accessing 'stl->neighbors_start[facet].neighbor[edgeX]'. The values retrieved (neighbor1, neighbor2, neighbor3) are then used as indices to write into 'stl->neighbors_start', potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write. This can result in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function `stl_remove_degenerate` uses the `facet` parameter as an index to access `stl->facet_start` and `stl->neighbors_start` arrays without performing any bounds checking. If an attacker provides a `facet` value that is out of the valid range (negative or exceeding array size), it will lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing array elements and potentially an out-of-bounds write when modifying neighbor data, resulting in a denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
