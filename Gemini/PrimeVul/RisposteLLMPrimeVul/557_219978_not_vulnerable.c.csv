This allows an attacker to read, write, or execute files outside of the intended directory.","The code retrieves a plugin module name from user-controlled URL parameters (request->map_url, ""name"") and passes it directly to the get_plugin_module function without any apparent sanitization or validation. If get_plugin_module uses this name to construct a file path for loading or accessing plugin resources, an attacker could exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability by providing a name like ../../etc/passwd to access arbitrary files on the system."

"4","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code retrieves a plugin name from user-controlled URL parameters (u_map_get(request->map_url, ""name"")) and passes it directly to the get_plugin_module function without any apparent sanitization or validation. If get_plugin_module uses this name to construct a file path for loading a plugin or its configuration, an attacker could exploit this by providing path traversal sequences (e.g., ""../"") in the 'name' parameter. This could allow the attacker to access, read, or potentially execute arbitrary files outside the intended plugin directory, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or remote code execution."
