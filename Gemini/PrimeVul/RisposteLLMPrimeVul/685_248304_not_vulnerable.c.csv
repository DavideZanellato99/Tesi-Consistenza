"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string that is externally controlled, which can lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.","The cfg_error function uses vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap) where fmt is a format string passed as an argument. If an attacker can control the content of the fmt argument, they can inject malicious format specifiers (e.g., %x, %s, %n). This can lead to information disclosure, arbitrary memory read/write, or even arbitrary code execution, as the function does not sanitize or validate the fmt string before passing it to vfprintf."

"3","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string that is externally controlled, which can lead to information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.","The cfg_error function uses vfprintf with a format string fmt that is passed directly from its caller. If an attacker can control the value of fmt, they can inject format specifiers (e.g., %x, %s, %n) into the string. This can lead to information disclosure (reading stack data), arbitrary memory writes (via %n), or denial of service, as the vfprintf function will interpret these specifiers and attempt to access arguments that may not exist or are of incorrect types, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. The same vulnerability applies if cfg->errfunc is a variadic function that also uses the provided fmt string as a format string."
