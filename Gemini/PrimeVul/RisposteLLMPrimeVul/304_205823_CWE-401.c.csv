"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which might be exploited to consume excessive resources and cause a denial of service.","The code acquires a mutex lock (ipf->ipf_lock) before calling ipf_handle_frag and releases it afterwards. If ipf_handle_frag is a computationally intensive or blocking operation, holding this lock for its entire duration creates a critical section that can become a performance bottleneck. An attacker could exploit this by sending a large number of valid IP fragments, causing ipf_handle_frag to be called repeatedly under the lock. This would serialize the processing of all fragments for this ipf instance, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) by significantly degrading the system's ability to process network traffic due to uncontrolled consumption of CPU resources."

"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be exploited by an attacker to consume an excessive amount of resources, leading to a denial of service.","The code processes network packet fragments. If ipf_handle_frag fails to process a fragment, the packet is refilled into the batch using dp_packet_batch_refill. If a malicious or malformed fragment consistently causes ipf_handle_frag to fail, and there is no apparent mechanism to eventually drop such a packet after a certain number of retries or a timeout, the system could enter a loop where it repeatedly attempts to process the same problematic packet. This continuous re-processing of an unhandleable packet would consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition."
