"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application crashes or behaves unpredictably. This can be caused by various programming errors, such as failing to initialize a pointer, freeing a pointer and then using it, or passing a NULL pointer to a function that does not expect it.","The code attempts to dereference the result of a map::find operation without checking if the key was actually found. Specifically, the expression init_op_sig_it->second.outputs().find(kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey)->second.name() will lead to undefined behavior, likely a crash, if kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey is not present in the outputs map of the found signature definition. The outer check for init_op_sig_it only ensures the key exists in the main signature_def map, not in the nested outputs map."

"5","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically causes a program crash or exit, which might be exploitable by an attacker.","The code dereferences an iterator returned by outputs().find(kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey) without checking if the iterator is valid (i.e., not end()). If kSavedModelInitOpSignatureKey is found in the top-level signature_def map but not within the outputs() map of the corresponding SignatureDef, dereferencing the invalid iterator will lead to undefined behavior, likely a program crash."
