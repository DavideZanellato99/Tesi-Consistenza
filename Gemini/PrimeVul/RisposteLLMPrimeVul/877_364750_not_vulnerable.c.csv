"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities if the overflowed value is used in subsequent operations like buffer sizing or loop counters.","The 'cmplen' variable, an 'int', is assigned the result of 'tagpp->tagname_end - tagpp->tagname', which is of type 'ptrdiff_t'. If the difference between these pointers (representing the length of a tag name) exceeds 'INT_MAX' due to an extremely long line in a tags file, 'cmplen' will suffer an integer overflow, potentially becoming a negative value. When this negative 'cmplen' is subsequently cast to 'size_t' for use in string comparison functions like 'STRNCMP', 'tag_strnicmp', or 'MB_STRNICMP', it will be converted into a very large unsigned 'size_t' value. This excessively large length will cause these comparison functions to attempt to read far beyond the bounds of the provided buffers ('tagpp->tagname' and 'st->orgpat->head'), leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in a denial of service (crash) or potentially information disclosure."

"5","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of a command using externally-controlled input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended command when it is executed.","The code parses a tags file and extracts a ""command"" string into tagpp->command without any sanitization or validation. If an attacker can provide a malicious tags file, they can embed arbitrary commands in this field. A subsequent component that executes or interprets this extracted command without proper sanitization could lead to arbitrary code execution, such as command injection or script injection."
