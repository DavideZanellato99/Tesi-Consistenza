"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs bounds checking for 'index' values retrieved from node attributes for both '_Arg' and '_Retval' nodes, preventing out-of-bounds access. It also includes null pointer checks using CHECK_NOTNULL and proper error handling via TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR. The explicit management of ShapeHandle object lifetimes for '_Retval' nodes by creating a new handle in the outer context prevents potential use-after-free or dangling pointer issues. No immediate security vulnerabilities were identified."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet properly validates the 'index' attribute retrieved from the node definition. For both '_Arg' and '_Retval' nodes, it performs explicit bounds checking (index < 0 || outer_context->num_inputs() <= index and index < 0 || outer_context->num_outputs() <= index respectively) before using the index to access or set elements in the 'outer_context'. This prevents out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities. The error handling for invalid indices is also present, returning an internal error status."
