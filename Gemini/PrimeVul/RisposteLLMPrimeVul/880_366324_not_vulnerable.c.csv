"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, causing a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The code decrements reference counts for 'old_mp' and 'old_parent'. If these objects are concurrently freed by another thread due to insufficient synchronization, calling 'put_mountpoint' or 'mnt_add_count' on them could result in a double-free, leading to memory corruption or system instability."
"2","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.","The code decrements reference counts for `old_mp` and `old_parent`, which can lead to their deallocation. If other threads concurrently access these objects after they have been freed, for example, by reading `mnt->mnt_mp` or `mnt->mnt_parent` before `mnt` is fully re-attached, it results in a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This is a race condition due to insufficient synchronization around shared data structures and resource deallocation."
