"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not gracefully handle the resulting error. This typically causes a program to crash, leading to a denial of service.","The function GetDeviceForInput takes a TensorHandle* tensor_handle as an argument. There is no check to ensure that tensor_handle is not nullptr before it is dereferenced. For example, the first line that accesses tensor_handle is tensor_handle->Type(). If a nullptr is passed for tensor_handle, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash and a denial of service."
