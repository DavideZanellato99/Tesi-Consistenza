"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string with an attacker-controlled buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow, information disclosure, or denial of service.","The code snippet passes the output of the tgoto function to OUT_STR. If OUT_STR is a printf-like function (e.g., printf, fprintf), and the T_CAL string constant contains format specifiers (such as %s, %x, or %n) that tgoto does not fully process or escape according to terminfo rules, these specifiers will be passed through to the string returned by tgoto. When this string is then used as the format string for printf, it creates a format string vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, or cause a denial of service, by manipulating the line_count argument or relying on the unhandled format specifiers in T_CAL."
