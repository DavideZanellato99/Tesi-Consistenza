"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The program does not properly synchronize concurrent access to a shared resource. This can lead to a race condition, which can have various impacts depending on the exact nature of the shared resource and the operations being performed.","The function restores a signal mask. If this operation occurs at an inappropriate time, it can prematurely unblock signals that should remain blocked during a critical operation, leading to a race condition where an attacker could send a signal to interrupt the sensitive code, potentially causing an inconsistent state or other security issues."
"2","True","CWE-457","Use of Uninitialized Variable","The software uses a variable that has not been initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, incorrect calculations, or information disclosure, depending on the context and the value present in the uninitialized memory.","The code snippet uses the `old_sigmask` variable to restore a signal mask. If `old_sigmask` has not been properly initialized with a valid signal mask (e.g., by a prior call to `sigprocmask` with `SIG_BLOCK` or `SIG_SETMASK` and `oldset` not `NULL`), then using its potentially uninitialized or default-initialized value can lead to an unexpected and potentially insecure signal mask state. This could result in critical signals being unblocked when they should be blocked, leading to unexpected program termination or other security implications depending on the application's signal handling logic."
