"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not sufficiently control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code uses an int64_t variable `rank` to determine the size of a `std::vector<DimensionHandle> dims` via `dims.resize(rank)`. If an attacker can manipulate input to cause `rank` to become an extremely large positive value, this will lead to an attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory, potentially exhausting system resources and causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Furthermore, if `rank` exceeds `INT_MAX`, the loop counter `i` (an `int32_t`) in the subsequent `for` loop will overflow, leading to undefined behavior and incorrect processing of dimensions."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to be robust and handles various input conditions and potential issues. It correctly checks for null pointers for 'perm' before dereferencing it. It validates the 'rank' and 'perm_elems' using 'WithRank' and 'WithValue' to ensure consistency. Crucially, it includes a bounds check 'if (in_idx >= rank)' before accessing 'c->Dim(input, in_idx)', preventing out-of-bounds reads. The 'dims.resize(rank)' operation is performed with a 'rank' value that represents a tensor's rank, which is typically a small, constrained integer in TensorFlow, making excessive memory allocation unlikely to be a practical vulnerability."
