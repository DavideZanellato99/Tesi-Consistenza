"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code calculates a pointer 'info' based on an offset ('OutputBufferOffset') from an untrusted network response. However, this pointer is only dereferenced inside the 'smb2_copy_fs_info_to_kstatfs' function, which is conditionally called only if 'smb2_validate_iov' returns success. The 'smb2_validate_iov' function is responsible for verifying that the provided offset and length are within the bounds of the allocated response buffer ('rsp_iov'). This validation step effectively prevents out-of-bounds memory access before the 'info' pointer is used."
