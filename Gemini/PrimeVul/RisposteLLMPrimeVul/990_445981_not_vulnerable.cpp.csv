"1","True","CWE-316","Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory","The product stores sensitive information in memory in a way that it can be read by an attacker. This can occur if the information is stored in cleartext, or if it is not properly protected from memory dumps or other memory inspection techniques.","The code snippet handles sensitive information, specifically passwords (the 'password' parameter and 'window->priv->password'), as plain 'const char *' strings. These passwords are passed to functions like 'convert_data_new' and 'fr_archive_extract'. This practice implies that the passwords are stored and processed in cleartext in memory. Without explicit memory protection mechanisms, such as zeroing out the memory containing the password immediately after use, preventing memory from being swapped to disk, or using secure memory regions, an attacker who can dump the process's memory (e.g., through a crash dump or by exploiting another memory-related vulnerability) could potentially retrieve these sensitive credentials."
"2","True","CWE-316","Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory","The product stores sensitive information in memory in cleartext. This can occur when the product stores sensitive data in a data structure that is not protected, or when the product fails to clear sensitive data from memory after it is no longer needed.","The code handles sensitive passwords (the 'password' argument and 'window->priv->password') as 'const char *' strings, storing them in cleartext memory. There is no visible mechanism within the snippet to securely manage these passwords, such as encrypting them in memory, using secure memory regions, or zeroing them out after they are no longer needed. This allows passwords to persist in memory longer than necessary, making them susceptible to memory inspection by an attacker with sufficient privileges or through memory dumps."
