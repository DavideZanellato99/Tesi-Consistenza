"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can often lead to crashes or other faults that could be used to deny service to legitimate users. In some cases, it can also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, or even arbitrary code execution if the read data is used to control program flow.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the issuer parsing logic. Specifically, within the loop that extracts the issuer value, the condition `is->bv_len < x.bv_len` controls the loop, but the expression `is->bv_val[is->bv_len+1]` is accessed. When `is->bv_len` is equal to `x.bv_len - 1`, `is->bv_val[is->bv_len+1]` attempts to read one byte beyond the allocated buffer pointed to by `is->bv_val`, which is a substring of the input `in->bv_val` with length `x.bv_len`. This can lead to information disclosure, crashes, or other undefined behavior."
