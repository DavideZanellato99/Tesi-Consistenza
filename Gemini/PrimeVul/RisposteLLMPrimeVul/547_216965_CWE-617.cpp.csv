"1","True","CWE-129","Uncontrolled Array Index","The product uses an array, but it either does not restrict or incorrectly restricts an index into the array, which can lead to a read or write of memory outside of the intended bounds of the array.","The variable 'cnt', derived from 'table_ref->shared', is used as an index to access 'tmp_table_param' and 'tmp_tables' without any explicit bounds checking within this code snippet. If 'cnt' can be controlled by an attacker or can exceed the allocated size of these arrays, it will result in an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses the variable 'cnt', derived from 'table_ref->shared', as an index for accessing 'tmp_table_param' and 'tmp_tables'. If 'table_ref->shared' is not adequately validated to ensure it remains within the allocated bounds of these arrays, a crafted input (e.g., a complex SQL query) could cause 'cnt' to exceed array limits. This would result in an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption, which can cause denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
