"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is executed.","The code constructs an OS command using the 'editor' variable, which is retrieved from user-controlled environment variables (VISUAL or EDITOR). The 'editor' string is directly inserted into the command line without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker can manipulate these environment variables to inject arbitrary shell commands, leading to OS command injection. For example, setting VISUAL to '/bin/sh -c ""malicious_command #""' would execute 'malicious_command' when the 'cmdline' is run."
