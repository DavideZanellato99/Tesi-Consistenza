"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The NameBuff buffer is populated by get_trans_bufname and then multiple strings are concatenated using STRCPY without checking if the destination buffer has sufficient space. The 'len' variable tracks the current length, but STRCPY does not respect the overall buffer capacity, leading to potential writes beyond the allocated memory for NameBuff."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code appends multiple strings to the NameBuff buffer using STRCPY and direct character assignment without performing bounds checks. The 'len' variable tracks the current string length but is never validated against the buffer's maximum capacity (likely MAXPATHL). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the combined length of the initial buffer content and appended strings exceeds NameBuff's allocated size, resulting in an out-of-bounds write."
