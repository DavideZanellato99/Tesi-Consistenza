"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource, which can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.","The code performs an unchecked downcast from GF_Box* to GF_MHAConfigBox*. If the input pointer 's' does not actually point to a GF_MHAConfigBox object, accessing 'ptr->mha_config' will result in reading memory out of bounds or interpreting arbitrary memory as a pointer. This type confusion can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as double-free, use-after-free, or arbitrary free when gf_free is called on the potentially invalid pointer, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The mhac_box_del function frees memory pointed to by ptr->mha_config and then frees the memory pointed to by s. If this function is called multiple times with the same GF_Box *s argument, it will attempt to free the same memory regions more than once. The second call to gf_free(s) will result in a double free vulnerability. Accessing ptr->mha_config in a subsequent call after s has been freed also constitutes a use-after-free, which could lead to a double free of ptr->mha_config if its value remains unchanged."
