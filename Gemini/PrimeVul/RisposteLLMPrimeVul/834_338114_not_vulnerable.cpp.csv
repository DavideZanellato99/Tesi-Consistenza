"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including incorrect error handling, race conditions, or improper initialization.","The code allocates memory for a Unary object using allocator.alloc<Unary>() but does not check if the allocation was successful before dereferencing the returned pointer. If allocator.alloc<Unary>() returns nullptr due to memory allocation failure, subsequent attempts to access members of curr (e.g., curr->op, curr->value, curr->finalize()) will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
