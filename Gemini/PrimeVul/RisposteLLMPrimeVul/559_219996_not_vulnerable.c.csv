"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements in the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code retrieves a 'name' from the request's URL map, which is user-controlled input. This 'name' is then passed directly to the 'get_user_module' function. If 'get_user_module' uses this input to construct a file path or resource identifier without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker could supply directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../') to access or retrieve arbitrary files or resources outside the intended directory or scope."

"5","True","CWE-863","Incorrect Authorization","The software does not perform an authorization check when an object or function is accessed, or it performs an authorization check but it does not correctly implement the intended policy. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.","The code retrieves a module name directly from user-controlled input (request->map_url, ""name"") and uses it to fetch a user module. The snippet does not perform any authorization checks to ensure the requesting user is permitted to access the specified module. This lack of authorization in the callback could allow an attacker to access or enumerate modules they are not authorized to view, leading to a Broken Access Control or Information Disclosure vulnerability if the underlying get_user_module function also lacks robust authorization."
