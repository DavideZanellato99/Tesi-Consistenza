"1","True","CWE-467","Use of a Non-reentrant Function","A function is non-reentrant if it cannot be safely called again while it is already executing, or if it cannot be safely called by multiple threads concurrently, because it uses global or static data that is modified during execution.","The function returns a pointer to a static variable `pos_copy`. Subsequent calls to `find_start_brace` will overwrite the content of `pos_copy`, invalidating any previously returned pointers to this static memory. This can lead to unexpected or incorrect program behavior if a caller relies on the stability of the data pointed to by the returned pointer."

"5","True","CWE-467","Use of a Non-existent or Stale Pointer","The product uses a pointer that refers to a memory location that has been freed, reallocated, or otherwise invalidated, leading to unpredictable behavior or a crash.","The function find_start_brace returns a pointer to a static local variable pos_copy. Since pos_copy is static, its content is overwritten with new data on each subsequent call to find_start_brace. If a caller stores the returned pointer from one call and then calls find_start_brace again, the data pointed to by the first stored pointer will be silently modified, making it stale. This can lead to unexpected program behavior, incorrect logic, or crashes if the caller relies on the original data."
