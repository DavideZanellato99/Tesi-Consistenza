"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product uses an operation that can result in a divide-by-zero error, which can lead to a denial of service or other consequences.","The code is vulnerable to a division-by-zero error. If lprn->nBh is zero, or if lprn->BlockLine is less than lprn->nBh (causing integer division lprn->BlockLine / lprn->nBh to be zero), then maxY will be calculated as zero. Subsequently, the modulo operation y0 = (r + h - bh) % maxY will result in a division by zero, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior."

"3","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to a crash or exit condition.","The code is vulnerable to a divide-by-zero error. If the member `lprn->nBh` is zero, the calculation `lprn->BlockLine / lprn->nBh` will cause a program crash. Similarly, if `lprn->BlockLine` is zero (and `lprn->nBh` is non-zero), `maxY` will become zero, leading to a division by zero in the subsequent calculation `(r + h - bh) % maxY`. Both scenarios result in a denial of service. Additionally, if the expression `(r + h - bh)` evaluates to a negative number, the modulo operation `(r + h - bh) % maxY` can yield a negative `y0` value. This negative `y0` is then used to compute an offset into `lprn->ImageBuf`, potentially causing an out-of-bounds read (underflow) if `(y0 + y)` becomes negative, which could lead to information disclosure or further denial of service."
