"1","True","CWE-369","Divide-by-Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to an exception or an incorrect result. This can occur in integer or floating-point arithmetic. In integer arithmetic, division by zero typically causes a program crash or an exception. In floating-point arithmetic, division by zero often results in an infinite or Not-a-Number (NaN) value, which can propagate through calculations and lead to incorrect results or unexpected program behavior.","The code performs division operations using screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorX and screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorY without checking if these denominators are zero. If either scaleFactorX or scaleFactorY is zero, a floating-point division-by-zero error will occur, resulting in xPosition or yPosition becoming INF (infinity) or NaN (not a number). While floating-point division by zero typically doesn't crash the program directly, the propagation of INF or NaN values can lead to unexpected application behavior, rendering issues, or denial of service if subsequent operations do not handle these special floating-point values correctly."
"2","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product uses a division operation where the divisor is not checked to ensure that it is non-zero. This can lead to a crash or other undesirable behavior.","The code performs division operations using screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorX and screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorY without checking if these denominators are zero. If either screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorX or screenRenderInfo.scaleFactorY can be zero, a division-by-zero error will occur, leading to undefined behavior, program termination, or the propagation of NaN/INF values which could cause further issues in subsequent calculations or object property settings."
