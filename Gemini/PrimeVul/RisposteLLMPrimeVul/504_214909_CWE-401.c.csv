"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer value that is too large to store in the intended data type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The calculation of 'inlen' involves 'sizeof(u64) * conn->cq.wq_ctrl.buf.npages'. If 'conn->cq.wq_ctrl.buf.npages' is sufficiently large, the result of this multiplication can exceed the maximum value representable by an 'int' type. When this result is assigned to the 'inlen' variable, which is declared as 'int', an integer overflow (truncation) occurs, causing 'inlen' to hold a smaller, incorrect value. Consequently, 'kvzalloc' allocates a buffer that is smaller than actually needed. Later, 'mlx5_fill_page_frag_array' attempts to write data based on the original, larger 'conn->cq.wq_ctrl.buf.npages' into this undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow."
