This typically occurs when a program tries to use a pointer whose value is NULL, often resulting in a segmentation fault or access violation.","The code contains a potential null pointer dereference. The assert(avc->s_info.sps); statement is used to check if avc->s_info.sps is not null. However, if assertions are disabled (e.g., in a release build by defining NDEBUG), this check is removed. Consequently, if avc->s_info.sps is null, the subsequent access to avc->s_info.sps->poc_type will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a program crash."

"4","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a NULL pointer, which can cause a crash or exit, leading to a denial of service.","The code contains a potential NULL pointer dereference. Inside the handling for slice NAL unit types (e.g., GF_AVC_NALU_IDR_SLICE), there is an assertion `assert(avc->s_info.sps);`. This assertion checks if the `sps` pointer within `avc->s_info` is valid. However, in release builds, assertions are often compiled out, removing this check. If `avc->s_info.sps` is NULL when the code reaches subsequent dereferences like `avc->s_info.sps->poc_type`, it will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing the program to crash. An attacker could potentially craft a malformed input stream that results in `avc->s_info.sps` being NULL at this point, leading to a Denial of Service."
