"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located within a restricted directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code retrieves a 'name' parameter from the URL, which is user-controlled input. This 'name' is then passed to the 'get_user_middleware_module' function. If 'get_user_middleware_module' uses this input to access a file or resource on the server's file system without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker could exploit a Path Traversal vulnerability. By crafting a malicious 'name' (e.g., '../../../../etc/passwd'), an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server. The content of the retrieved file, if it can be parsed as JSON and contains a 'module' field, would then be returned in the HTTP response, leading to information disclosure."
