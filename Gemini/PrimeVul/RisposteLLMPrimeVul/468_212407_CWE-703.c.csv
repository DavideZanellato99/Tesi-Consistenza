"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code snippet accesses array elements fm->hdf[u] and fm->hd[u] using the u parameter as an index without performing any bounds checking. If the value of u exceeds the allocated size of the fm->hdf or fm->hd arrays, it will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code uses the 'u' parameter as an index to access 'fm->hdf' and 'fm->hd' arrays without any bounds checking. If 'u' is greater than or equal to the size of these arrays, it will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to undefined behavior such as a crash (denial of service) or potential information disclosure."
