"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some circumstances, allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Inside the inner loop, which iterates with index 'j' from 0 to t->args_size() - 1, the expression 't->mutable_args(i)' incorrectly uses the outer loop's index 'i' instead of the inner loop's index 'j'. If 'i' is greater than or equal to 't->args_size()', this will result in an out-of-bounds access, leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or a crash."
