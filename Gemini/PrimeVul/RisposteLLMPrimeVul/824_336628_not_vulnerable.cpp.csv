"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory address and still contains a NULL value. This typically causes the application to crash, leading to a Denial of Service.","The function does not perform null checks on the 'reds' pointer or its 'config' member before dereferencing them. If 'reds' or 'reds->config' is NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash and a Denial of Service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid memory location (i.e., it is NULL). This typically causes a program crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The function does not validate if the 'reds' pointer or 'reds->config' pointer is NULL before dereferencing them. If either pointer is NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
