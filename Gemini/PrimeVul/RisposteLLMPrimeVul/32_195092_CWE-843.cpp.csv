"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function hermes::evalUnaryOperator can return a nullptr if an unsupported UnaryOperatorInst::OpKind is provided (e.g., any kind not explicitly handled in the outer switch statement), or if UnaryOperatorInst::OpKind::MinusKind is used with an operand of ValueKind not explicitly handled (e.g., LiteralStringKind). If the caller of this function does not check for a nullptr return value before dereferencing the result, it will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a program crash and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for a condition that is not expected to occur, but could be introduced by an attacker or by an unusual operating environment. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or security bypasses.","The `TypeofKind` case in the `switch` statement uses `llvm_unreachable` in its `default` case. This means if the `operand` has a valid `ValueKind` that is not explicitly handled (e.g., LiteralBigIntKind, LiteralSymbolKind, LiteralFunctionKind, LiteralObjectKind for non-global objects), the program will terminate abruptly. In a JavaScript engine, these are valid types for which `typeof` should return a specific string (e.g., ""bigint"", ""symbol"", ""function"", ""object""). An attacker could craft input that results in an operand of one of these unhandled but valid types, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the program crash. This indicates an improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions."
