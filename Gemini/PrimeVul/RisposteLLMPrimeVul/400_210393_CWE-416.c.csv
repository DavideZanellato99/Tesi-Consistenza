"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The 'opened_len' variable is initialized based on 'ARGCOUNT' at the beginning of the function. The 'count' variable, used for the main loop, is also derived from 'opened_len'. The code explicitly states that autocommands can change the size of the argument list ('alist->al_ga.ga_len'). If an autocommand, triggered during the second main loop (e.g., by 'do_ecmd'), reduces 'alist->al_ga.ga_len' to a value smaller than the current loop index 'i', then the subsequent access 'alist_name(&AARGLIST(alist)[i])' will attempt to read from an out-of-bounds memory location. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The variable 'opened_len' is initialized based on 'ARGCOUNT', and the loop iterating from 'i = 0' to 'count - 1' (where 'count' is capped by 'opened_len') accesses 'AARGLIST(alist)[i]' without re-validating the bounds of 'alist->al_ga.ga_len'. The code explicitly notes that autocommands can modify the argument list, including its size. If an autocommand, triggered by functions like 'do_ecmd' within the loop, causes 'alist->al_ga.ga_len' to shrink, a subsequent access to 'AARGLIST(alist)[i]' where 'i' is greater than or equal to the new, smaller 'alist->al_ga.ga_len' will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior."
