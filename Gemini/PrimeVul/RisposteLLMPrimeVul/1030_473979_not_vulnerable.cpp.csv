"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without properly checking the size of the input, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can result in corruption of data, a crash, or arbitrary code execution.","The memcpy function copies data from table->bins into the local stack array packed_bins. The size of packed_bins is fixed by MAX_PACKED_NUMHASH*2. If table->num_entries exceeds MAX_PACKED_NUMHASH, the memcpy will attempt to write more data than the packed_bins array can hold, leading to a stack buffer overflow. This can corrupt adjacent stack data, lead to denial of service, or potentially allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution."

"4","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without properly checking the size of the input, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The `packed_bins` array is allocated on the stack with a fixed size determined by `MAX_PACKED_NUMHASH*2`. The `memcpy` operation copies data from `table->bins` into `packed_bins` using `table->num_entries*2` as the size multiplier. If `table->num_entries*2` exceeds `MAX_PACKED_NUMHASH*2`, the `memcpy` will write beyond the bounds of the `packed_bins` array, corrupting the stack and leading to undefined behavior, potentially including crashes or arbitrary code execution."
