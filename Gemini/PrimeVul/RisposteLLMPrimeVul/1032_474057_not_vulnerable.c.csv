"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The function uses a lookup table to find a string literal 's' based on a hash of the user-provided 'str' and 'len'. The comparison logic includes 'strncmp(str + 1, s + 1, len - 1)' and 's[len] == '\0''. The 'len' parameter, which is controlled by the caller, is used for the length of the comparison and for indexing into 's'. However, there is no check to ensure that the user-provided 'len' does not exceed the actual length of the string literal 's' retrieved from the 'uniname2ctype_pool'. If an attacker provides a 'len' value greater than the actual length of the matched string literal 's', both 'strncmp' and the access 's[len]' will attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer for 's', leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service (crash), or other undefined behavior. The 'wordlist' entries contain an explicit length for each string, but this length is not used to validate the user-provided 'len'."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code performs string comparisons using a user-provided length (len) without validating it against the actual length of the target string (s). The wordlist array contains entries with an offset to a string and an associated integer value, which is likely the intended length of that string. However, this associated length is not used in the comparison logic. Specifically, the `!strncmp (str + 1, s + 1, len - 1)` and `s[len] == '\0'` checks use the input `len`. If the input `len` is greater than the actual length of the string `s` (which is fixed for each entry in the `uniname2ctype_pool`), these operations will read past the end of the string `s`, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service (crash), or other unpredictable behavior."
