"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but it has not confirmed that the pointer is not NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code accesses members of pointers such as vm->top_frame->function->context and ctx->await without explicit null checks. If vm->top_frame, vm->top_frame->function, ctx, or ctx->await are null due to an unexpected VM state or prior memory corruption, dereferencing them will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash (denial of service)."

"3","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit in some cases. This can lead to a denial of service or other impacts depending on the context.","The code performs multiple chained dereferences without explicit null checks for intermediate pointers such as 'ctx', 'ctx->await', 'async_frame', and 'async->function'. For example, 'async_frame = ctx->await;' will dereference 'ctx' which could be NULL if 'vm->top_frame->function->context' was NULL. Similarly, 'async = &async_frame->native;' will dereference 'async_frame' which could be NULL if 'ctx->await' was NULL. An attacker could potentially craft input or exploit a prior bug to make one of these pointers NULL, leading to a Null Pointer Dereference and a denial of service."
