"1","True","CWE-89","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')","The software constructs all or part of a SQL query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended SQL query when it is sent to a downstream component.","The method `grouping_field_transformer_for_where` implies a transformation or sanitization of input, particularly for a SQL WHERE clause, given the `arg` parameter. However, the method simply returns `this` without performing any operations on `arg`. If `arg` contains user-controlled data and is subsequently used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, this lack of transformation can lead to SQL injection or other forms of data query manipulation."
