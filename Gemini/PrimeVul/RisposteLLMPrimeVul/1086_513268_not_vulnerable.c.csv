"1","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that produces an incorrect value, which can lead to various problems. This can include incorrect pointer arithmetic, incorrect array indexing, or other mathematical errors.","The code snippet uses `record[1]` in calls to `store_record` and `restore_record`. Given that `table->record[0]` is used elsewhere in the function, it is highly probable that `table->record[1]` was intended. If `record` is an implicitly declared global variable, this constitutes an unintended access to a global resource instead of the intended member of the `table` structure. This can lead to data corruption, information leakage, or a crash if the global `record` is uninitialized or points to invalid memory, representing an incorrect data reference."
