"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. The loop condition `destination_p < destination_end_p` ensures that `destination_p` is within the bounds of the destination buffer at the start of each iteration. However, functions called within the loop, specifically `lit_code_point_to_cesu8_bytes` (writing up to 3 bytes) and `lit_four_byte_utf8_char_to_cesu8` (writing 6 bytes), can write multiple bytes. If the remaining space in the destination buffer is less than the number of bytes these functions attempt to write, an out-of-bounds write will occur. For example, if `destination_p` is `destination_end_p - 2` and `lit_code_point_to_cesu8_bytes` writes 3 bytes, it will write one byte past the allocated buffer. Additionally, the lack of a length parameter for the `source_p` buffer and the use of `lexer_unchecked_hex_to_character` could lead to out-of-bounds reads from the source buffer if it is malformed or not properly terminated."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of the intended buffer.","The function converts characters from a source buffer to a destination buffer. The loop condition `destination_p < destination_end_p` only checks the destination buffer bounds at the start of each iteration.

If the remaining space in the destination buffer is less than the number of bytes required for the current conversion, an out-of-bounds write will occur before the loop condition is re-evaluated, leading to a buffer overflow."
