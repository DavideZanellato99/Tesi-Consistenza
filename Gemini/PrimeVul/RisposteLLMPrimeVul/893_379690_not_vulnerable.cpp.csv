"1","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates resources, but it does not limit or throttle the rate or quantity of resources that are allocated, which can exhaust available resources.","The code uses r_strbuf_appendf to append user-controlled strings (vp->name, vp->type) to a dynamic string buffer. While sanitize_var_serial is called, its implementation is unknown and it might not enforce length limits on the input strings. If an attacker can provide excessively long strings for vp->name or vp->type, the RStrBuf could attempt to allocate a very large amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. There is no format string vulnerability as the format string is a constant literal."
"2","True","CWE-138","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Representation","The product receives input with special elements that are not properly neutralized before the data is stored or processed. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data by a downstream component, potentially causing data integrity issues, logical errors, or other vulnerabilities.","The code serializes data into a colon-delimited string using r_strbuf_appendf. Although sanitize_var_serial is called on vp->name and vp->type, its effectiveness against the colon delimiter is unknown. If sanitize_var_serial fails to properly neutralize or escape the colon character, a malicious or malformed vp->name or vp->type containing colons could lead to a malformed serialized string. This could cause a downstream parser to misinterpret the data, leading to data integrity issues or logical errors."
