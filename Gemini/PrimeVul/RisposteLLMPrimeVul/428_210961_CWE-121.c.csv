"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code increments desc->field_count and uses it as an index into the desc->field_len array without any bounds checking on desc->field_count itself. If desc->field_count exceeds the allocated size of desc->field_len, an out-of-bounds write will occur, potentially corrupting adjacent memory or leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The check on len only limits the value being written, not the index."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code increments desc->field_count and uses its current value as an index into the desc->field_len array. There is no check to ensure that desc->field_count does not exceed the allocated size of desc->field_len before the write operation. If this function is called repeatedly and desc->field_count grows beyond the buffer's capacity, an out-of-bounds write will occur, leading to a buffer overflow."
