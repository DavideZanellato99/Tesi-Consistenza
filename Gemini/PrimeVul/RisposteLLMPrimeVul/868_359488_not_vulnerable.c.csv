"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The software uses an externally-controlled format string in a function that accepts a format string as an argument, which can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code directly passes user-controlled input (argv[0], representing the ""WORD"" from the command line) to the bgp_show_summary_vty function without any prior sanitization or validation. This pattern is a common precursor to format string vulnerabilities if bgp_show_summary_vty uses this input as a format string argument in a printf-like function (e.g., printf(argv[0]) instead of printf(""%s"", argv[0])), potentially allowing an attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, disclose sensitive information, or cause a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","User-controlled input (argv[0]) is passed directly to the bgp_show_summary_vty function without any visible validation or sanitization in this snippet. This creates a risk that if bgp_show_summary_vty uses this input in a sensitive context (e.g., system command, file path, database query, format string, fixed-size buffer copy), it could lead to vulnerabilities such as command injection, path traversal, SQL injection, format string bugs, or buffer overflows."
