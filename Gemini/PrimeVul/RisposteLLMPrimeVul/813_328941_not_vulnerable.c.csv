"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code reads `attr->info.rtvp_annotations_attr.num_parameters` from `buffer[offset]` after `offset` has been advanced by 6. If the provided buffer size `sz` is less than or equal to 6, accessing `buffer[offset]` (which would be `buffer[6]`) will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code reads buffer[offset] to determine num_parameters after offset has been incremented to 6. If the provided buffer size (sz) is less than or equal to 6, this access will result in an out-of-bounds read. Furthermore, inside the loop, the condition if (offset > sz) should be if (offset >= sz). If offset equals sz, r_bin_java_annotation_array_new is called with buffer + sz and a size of 0. If this function attempts to read any data, it will cause an out-of-bounds read."
