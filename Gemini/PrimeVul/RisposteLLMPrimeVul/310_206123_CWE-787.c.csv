"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the disclosure of sensitive information.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the loop that processes sections. Specifically, within the `for (i = 0; i < hdr->n_sections && cursor < end; i++)` loop, the `r_read_ble` function is called to read `word_size` bytes from the `cursor` pointer. However, the check `if (cursor >= end)` to ensure the cursor remains within the allocated buffer `b` (ending at `end`) is performed *after* `cursor` has been incremented by `word_size`. This allows `r_read_ble` to read past the `end` of the buffer if `cursor` is sufficiently close to `end` such that `cursor + word_size` would exceed `end`. For example, if `word_size` is 8 and `cursor` is `end - 4`, `r_read_ble` will attempt to read 8 bytes, resulting in 4 bytes being read out of bounds. This can lead to information disclosure or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code contains an insufficient bounds check before reading data from a buffer. The condition `hdr->size > r_buf_size (buf) - off` does not correctly handle cases where the `off` parameter itself is beyond the buffer's size. If `off` is greater than `r_buf_size(buf)`, the unsigned subtraction `r_buf_size(buf) - off` will wrap around to a large positive value, causing the check to pass even when `off` is out of bounds. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when `r_buf_read_at` is called. Furthermore, in the loop processing sections, the condition `cursor < end` is used, but multiple `word_size` bytes are read from `cursor` before `cursor` is advanced and checked against `end`, potentially leading to another out-of-bounds read if `end - cursor` is less than `word_size`."
