"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a location past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the 'case 1' block, within the CP950 PUA handling logic, a 'for' loop iterates through 'cp950_pua_tbl'. If the loop completes without finding a matching entry (i.e., the 'break' statement is never executed), the loop variable 'k' will hold a value equal to the total number of rows in the 'cp950_pua_tbl' array. Immediately after the loop, the code attempts to access 'cp950_pua_tbl[k][2]' and 'cp950_pua_tbl[k][0]' using this out-of-bounds index 'k'. This results in an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to a crash (Denial of Service) or potentially information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the case 1 block, when processing CP950 Private Use Area characters, a loop iterates through `cp950_pua_tbl`. If no matching range is found, the loop variable `k` will increment past the last valid index of the array. Subsequently, `cp950_pua_tbl[k]` is accessed unconditionally outside the loop, resulting in an out-of-bounds read from memory. This could lead to information disclosure or a denial of service."
