"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","The program accesses memory that has been freed. Accessing freed memory can lead to crashes, corruption of valid data, or execution of arbitrary code.","The function retrieves a pointer to a yankreg_T structure using get_register and subsequently calls free_register on it. If get_register returns a pointer to a globally managed or shared resource, and free_register attempts to deallocate the memory, this can lead to a Use-After-Free vulnerability if other parts of the program access the freed pointer. Additionally, repeated calls to this function with the same regname could result in a Double Free vulnerability if get_register returns the same shared pointer and free_register deallocates it."
"2","True","CWE-763","Release of Invalid Pointer","The product attempts to release a pointer that is invalid. This can occur when the pointer was not allocated on the heap, or when the pointer has already been released.","The function `get_register` might return a pointer to a static, globally managed, or already freed memory region. If this occurs, the subsequent call to `free_register(reg)` would attempt to release an invalid pointer, leading to heap corruption, a double-free vulnerability, or a crash. The code assumes that `reg` always points to memory that needs to be freed by this specific call, which might not be true depending on the implementation of `get_register`."
