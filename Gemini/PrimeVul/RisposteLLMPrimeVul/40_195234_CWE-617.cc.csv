"1","True","CWE-915","Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes","The software allows an attacker to modify attributes of an object that are determined dynamically, without proper control or validation. This can lead to unintended behavior, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities.","The code iterates through user-controlled attributes from `arg_attrs` and directly adds them to the `NodeDef` without sufficient validation. An attacker could inject or override critical node attributes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or other security issues depending on the capabilities of the `AddAttr` function and the impact of specific attributes."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product uses or calculates a number that is larger than the maximum value intended for storage in a memory buffer or variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The `arg_index` variable is declared as an `int` but is initialized with `result_.nodes.size()` (a `size_t`) and then incremented `dtypes.size()` times within a loop. If `result_.nodes.size()` or `dtypes.size()` are sufficiently large, the `arg_index` variable can overflow, leading to an incorrect or wrapped-around integer value. This incorrect value is then used when calling `AddAttr(""index"", arg_index, gnode)`, which can result in logical errors or unexpected behavior in the graph construction process."
