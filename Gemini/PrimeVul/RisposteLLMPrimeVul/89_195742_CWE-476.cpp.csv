"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which can be NULL, causing a crash or exit.","The code attempts to access mov->moof->mfhd->sequence_number within the GF_ISOM_BOX_TYPE_MOOF case without checking if mov->moof->mfhd is a null pointer. If a malformed MOOF box is parsed that does not contain an MFHD (Movie Fragment Header Box), mov->moof->mfhd will be NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference and an application crash (Denial of Service)."

"3","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime, which might cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs or to the product itself. This can lead to a denial of service or to a system crash.","The code snippet contains multiple instances of a memory leak vulnerability. When a box is successfully parsed and allocated (e.g., 'a' from gf_isom_parse_root_box), it is then attempted to be added to the 'mov->TopBoxes' list using gf_list_add. If gf_list_add fails (returns an error 'e'), the function immediately returns 'e' without freeing the allocated box 'a'. This leaves the memory allocated for 'a' unreleased, leading to a memory leak. This pattern is observed for MOOV, META, MDAT, FTYP, PDIN, STYP/SIDX/SSIX (in debug mode), MOOF (in debug mode), UNKNOWN (non-JP), and default box types."
