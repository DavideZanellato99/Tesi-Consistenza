"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not adequately control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The function calls gdReallocDynamic with dp->logicalSize. If dp->logicalSize can be controlled by an attacker to be an excessively large value, this could lead to an attempt to allocate a huge amount of memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service. The code snippet does not validate the size of dp->logicalSize before passing it to the reallocation function."

The code snippet does not validate the size of dp->logicalSize before passing it to the reallocation function."
"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or buffer operations.","The function `trimDynamic` passes `dp->logicalSize` (an integer) directly to `gdReallocDynamic` without validating that it is non-negative. If an attacker can control `dp->logicalSize` and set it to a negative value, this negative integer will be interpreted as a very large unsigned size when used in memory allocation, leading to an integer overflow. This can result in an attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, potentially causing a denial of service due to memory exhaustion or a heap-based buffer overflow if the allocation succeeds and subsequent operations write past the intended bounds."
