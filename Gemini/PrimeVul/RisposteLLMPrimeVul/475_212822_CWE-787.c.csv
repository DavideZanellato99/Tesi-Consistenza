"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than or equal to the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.","The memcpy operation copies count bytes into the data buffer. The count variable is limited by max_data, which is provided by the caller. However, there is no check to ensure that the data buffer itself is actually allocated with a size of at least max_data bytes. If a malicious or erroneous caller provides a max_data value that is larger than the actual allocated size of the data buffer, a buffer overflow will occur, leading to potential arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

"5","True","CWE-119","Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer","The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.","The memcpy operation copies 'count' bytes into the 'data' buffer. The 'count' variable is determined by min(max_data, pcs->status.write_pos - pcs->status.read_pos). The function relies on the caller to provide a 'max_data' value that accurately reflects the allocated size of the 'data' buffer. If 'max_data' is greater than the actual size of the 'data' buffer, and pcs->status.write_pos - pcs->status.read_pos is sufficiently large, 'count' could be set to 'max_data', leading to a buffer overflow when memcpy writes beyond the bounds of the 'data' buffer. The function does not perform any bounds checking on the 'data' buffer itself, making it susceptible to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer."
