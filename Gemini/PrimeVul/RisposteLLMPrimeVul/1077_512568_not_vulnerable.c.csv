"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple getter function that returns a longlong value based on an internal state. It does not contain any direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or memory corruption issues within this snippet itself. Potential issues would depend on how has_value() and value are managed elsewhere, or how the returned value is used by the caller, but these are outside the scope of this specific snippet."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple getter-like function that returns an existing 'value' if 'has_value()' is true, otherwise it returns 0. It does not perform any operations that introduce direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs, or improper resource handling. The potential for vulnerabilities would depend on how 'value' is set and how the return value is used by the caller, but this snippet itself is safe."
