"1","True","CWE-59","Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')","The software attempts to access a file based on a path, but it does not properly prevent or control cases where the path may resolve to an unintended file due to symbolic links or hard links. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the file system and potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive files.","The code opens a PID file using `open` with `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`. If the `PIDFILE` path is located in a directory writable by an attacker, or if an attacker can replace the `PIDFILE` with a symbolic link to an arbitrary target file, the `O_TRUNC` flag will cause the target file of the symlink to be truncated. This is a classic symlink race vulnerability, allowing an attacker to delete or corrupt arbitrary files on the system."

"3","True","CWE-74","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component","The software generates output that includes special elements that are not neutralized, which can be interpreted as active content by a downstream component.","The code writes the process ID to a file using write(fd, pidstr, strlen(pidstr)+1). The +1 in the length argument causes the null terminator character (\0) from the pidstr buffer to be written to the PID file. PID files are typically text files containing only the process ID followed by a newline character. Writing an unexpected null terminator can lead to incorrect parsing by downstream components that read the PID file, potentially causing them to misinterpret the PID, truncate the string prematurely, or encounter parsing errors, which could result in denial of service or other unexpected behavior."
