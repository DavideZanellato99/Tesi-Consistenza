"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a memory allocation after it is no longer needed, resulting in a memory leak. This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service over time.","The code allocates memory for 'utask' using GF_SAFEALLOC. It then calls 'gf_strdup' to allocate and copy the 'log_name'. If 'gf_strdup' fails (e.g., due to memory exhaustion) and returns NULL, the previously allocated 'utask' memory is not freed. The function proceeds to call 'gf_fs_post_task' with a NULL 'log_name'. Unless 'gf_fs_post_task' is guaranteed to always free 'utask' even when 'log_name' is NULL or if it fails internally, this constitutes a memory leak of the 'utask' object."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program allocates memory but fails to free it after the memory is no longer needed. This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.","The code allocates memory for 'utask' and '_log_name' but does not check the return value of 'gf_fs_post_task'. If 'gf_fs_post_task' fails to process the task and does not take ownership or free the passed '_log_name' and 'utask' pointers, then the memory allocated for both will be leaked. Additionally, the return value of 'gf_strdup' for '_log_name' is not checked, which could lead to a NULL pointer being passed to 'gf_fs_post_task' if memory allocation fails for the string, potentially causing a crash or further leaks."
