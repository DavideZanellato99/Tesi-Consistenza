"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product uses a fixed-size buffer and reads or copies data from an external source into the buffer without properly validating that the size of the data does not exceed the buffer's capacity.","The code calculates total_slide_infos by summing n_slide_infos[i] values read from an external buffer. If this sum exceeds UT32_MAX, total_slide_infos will overflow and wrap around to a smaller value. This overflowed value is then used to allocate memory for the infos array. Later, the code iterates and populates the infos array using an index k. The actual number of elements k can reach may exceed the size of the undersized infos array, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when infos[k] is accessed. This is an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)."
