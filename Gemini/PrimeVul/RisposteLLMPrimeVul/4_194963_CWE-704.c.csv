"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product uses a fixed-size buffer in the heap, but the product can write more data than the buffer can hold. This can lead to overwriting adjacent data, corruption of heap metadata, or other memory corruption issues, potentially resulting in denial of service or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The 'key' variable is initially allocated using 'AcquireString(property)', which typically allocates memory based on the length of 'property'. However, later, 'FormatLocaleString(key, MaxTextExtent, ""%s"", description)' is called, using 'MaxTextExtent' as the buffer size. If the 'description' string is longer than the memory initially allocated for 'key' (i.e., 'strlen(property) + 1'), a buffer overflow will occur on the heap. This allows an attacker to write arbitrary data beyond the bounds of the 'key' buffer, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
