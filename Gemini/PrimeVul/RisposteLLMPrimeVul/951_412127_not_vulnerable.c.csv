"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet uses sodium_memcmp for memory comparison, which is a constant-time function. This effectively prevents timing side-channel attacks that could otherwise leak information about the compared data, such as cryptographic keys or shared secrets, if a non-constant-time comparison like standard memcmp were used. In isolation, this snippet is secure."
