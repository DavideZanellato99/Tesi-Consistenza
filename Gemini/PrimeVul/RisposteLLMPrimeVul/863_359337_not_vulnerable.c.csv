"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-controlled input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is executed.","The code passes user-controlled input (argv[0], representing the peer-group name) directly to the bgp_clear_vty function without any visible sanitization or validation within this snippet. If bgp_clear_vty constructs an operating system command using this input, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands by providing a specially crafted peer-group name, leading to OS command injection."

"5","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a user-controlled format string in a function that performs formatting, which can lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.","The code passes user-controlled input (argv[0], the peer-group name) directly to the bgp_clear_vty function. If bgp_clear_vty or any subsequent function uses this input as a format string in a printf-like function without proper sanitization, it could lead to a format string vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution."
