"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code reads pps_id from the bitstream and uses it to access avc->pps[pps_id]. It then retrieves sps_id from the resulting si->pps structure. This sps_id is subsequently used as an index to access avc->sps[si->pps->sps_id]. There is no bounds check on the value of si->pps->sps_id before it is used as an array index. An attacker could craft a malicious bitstream where sps_id is an out-of-bounds value, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the avc->sps array. This can result in a denial of service (crash) or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or information disclosure.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The value of `si->pps->sps_id` is used as an index into the `avc->sps` array without any prior bounds validation. While `pps_id` is checked, `si->pps->sps_id` is derived from the parsed PPS structure, which itself is controlled by the input bitstream. An attacker could craft a malicious bitstream where `si->pps->sps_id` is an out-of-range value, leading to an out-of-bounds read from `avc->sps`. This can result in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially information disclosure."
