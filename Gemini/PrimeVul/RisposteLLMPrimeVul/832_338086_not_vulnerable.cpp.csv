"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when a program attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location, often resulting in a crash or denial of service. This typically happens when memory allocation fails or a pointer is explicitly set to NULL and then used without a proper check.","The code allocates memory using allocator.alloc<Const>() but does not check if the allocation was successful (i.e., if curr is a null pointer) before dereferencing curr to assign values to its members. If allocator.alloc fails to allocate memory (e.g., due to an out-of-memory condition), curr will be a null pointer, and subsequent dereferences like curr->value = Literal(...) will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash and a denial of service."
