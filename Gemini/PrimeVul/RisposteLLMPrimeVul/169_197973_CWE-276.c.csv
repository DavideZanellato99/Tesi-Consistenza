"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. When exec_options.process is false, the loop responsible for copying command arguments iterates one too many times. Specifically, in the last iteration, xstrdup is called with argv[argc], which is a null pointer. This constitutes an out-of-bounds read from the argv array and can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-269","Improper Privilege Management","The product does not properly manage privileges, leading to a bypass of security restrictions or a potential escalation of privileges.","The code directly assigns security-sensitive attributes such as process capabilities, user, SELinux label, AppArmor profile, and environment variables from the `exec_options` structure to the new process. If `exec_options` is populated with untrusted user input without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker could specify privileged capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN), set a malicious user, or inject harmful environment variables (e.g., LD_PRELOAD) into the executed container process. This could lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, or bypass of security restrictions within the container or potentially on the host system. The code snippet lacks necessary validation or sanitization for these critical security parameters."
