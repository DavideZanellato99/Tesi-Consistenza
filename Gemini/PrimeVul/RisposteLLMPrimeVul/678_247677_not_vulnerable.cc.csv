"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a test case setup that defines TLS configurations using hardcoded paths to test data files. There is no external input that can be manipulated by an attacker to cause a security vulnerability such as path traversal, buffer overflow, or insecure configuration. The file paths are relative to an internal test directory (test_rundir) and are not user-controlled."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a C++ test case that sets up TLS configurations for testing purposes. It defines hardcoded YAML strings pointing to test certificate and key files relative to a 'test_rundir'. This snippet itself does not contain any direct security vulnerabilities as it is part of a testing framework and not production code. The paths are relative to a test directory, which is standard for test environments and not inherently exploitable in this context."
