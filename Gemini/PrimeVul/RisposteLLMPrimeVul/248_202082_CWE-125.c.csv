"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs an out-of-bounds read when parsing the num_bootstrap_methods field. After an initial offset increment of 6 bytes, the R_BIN_JAVA_USHORT macro attempts to read 2 bytes from the buffer at the current offset. If the total buffer size (sz) is less than 8 bytes, this read will access memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code attempts to read a 2-byte unsigned short for num_bootstrap_methods using R_BIN_JAVA_USHORT(buffer, offset) where offset is 6. This operation reads bytes from buffer[6] and buffer[7]. If the provided buffer size sz is less than 8 bytes, specifically if sz is 7, then buffer[7] will be an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure. There is no bounds check before this read."
