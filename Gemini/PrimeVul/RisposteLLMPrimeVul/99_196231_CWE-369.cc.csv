"1","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software constructs a file name or path using input from an external source, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the input that could modify the initially intended path.","The code constructs a file path `fname` from `fnames_[shard]` and passes it to `open_function_` without sanitization or validation. If the `fnames_` array can be populated from untrusted input (e.g., from a malicious checkpoint file), an attacker could inject malicious paths (e.g., using directory traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths) to access arbitrary files or special device files on the system. This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other file system attacks depending on the capabilities of `open_function_`."
"2","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software constructs a filename or path using input from an untrusted source, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the filename or path that could modify the intended path. This can allow an attacker to read, write, or execute files in arbitrary locations on the file system.","The `fname` variable, used to open a file via `open_function_`, is derived from `fnames_[shard]`. If the `fnames_` array is populated with untrusted input without proper validation, an attacker could supply malicious file paths. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `fname` to point to locations outside the intended data directory, leading to information disclosure or denial of service."
