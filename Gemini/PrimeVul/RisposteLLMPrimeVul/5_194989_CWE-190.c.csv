"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read from the input 'pixels' buffer. The function iterates 'image->columns' times, reading 'packet_size' bytes in each iteration using the 'p' pointer, which is advanced accordingly. However, there is no bounds checking to ensure that the total number of bytes read ('image->columns * packet_size') does not exceed the actual size of the 'pixels' buffer. An attacker could provide a crafted input with a large 'image->columns' value or an unexpected 'packet_size' to cause the 'p' pointer to read beyond the allocated memory region of the 'pixels' buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code reads pixel data from the 'pixels' buffer using pointer 'p'. The total amount of data read is determined by 'image->columns' and 'packet_size', both of which are likely derived from untrusted input (e.g., a PSD file header). There is no explicit bounds checking within this function to ensure that 'p' does not read beyond the allocated size of the 'pixels' buffer. An attacker could craft a malicious PSD file with large 'image->columns' or 'packet_size' values, leading to an out-of-bounds read, which can result in a denial of service or information disclosure."
