"1","True","CWE-284","Improper Access Control","The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.","The code directly uses a user-provided string (name) from ctx->input(0) to identify and delete a tensor from the session_state. There are no apparent authorization checks to ensure that the current context or user is permitted to delete the tensor identified by name. This lack of access control could allow an attacker to delete critical or sensitive tensors, leading to a denial of service or other unauthorized state modifications."
