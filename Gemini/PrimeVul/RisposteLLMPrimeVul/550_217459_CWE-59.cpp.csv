"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or absolute pathnames in the input. This allows an attacker to access or create files outside of the intended directory.","The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal (Zip Slip) attack. The `entryPath` is taken directly from the zip file's entry filename and used with `targetDirectory.getChildFile()`. An attacker can craft `entryPath` to contain directory traversal sequences like `../` or absolute paths, causing files or symbolic links to be written outside the intended `targetDirectory`. Additionally, for symbolic link entries, the `originalFilePath` (the link's target) is read directly from the stream, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary system path for the symbolic link to point to. This allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem or create symbolic links pointing to sensitive system files."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or similar constructs that can resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.

The `entryPath` from the zip entry's filename is directly used to construct `targetFile` via `targetDirectory.getChildFile` without proper sanitization or validation against `../` sequences. This allows an attacker to craft malicious zip files that, when uncompressed, write files or create symbolic links outside the intended `targetDirectory`, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious content in arbitrary locations. The explicit handling of symbolic links further exacerbates this by allowing attacker-controlled link targets."
