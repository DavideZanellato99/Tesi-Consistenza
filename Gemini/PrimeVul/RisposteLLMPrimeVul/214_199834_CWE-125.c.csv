"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code uses pointer arithmetic with `compl_leader + get_compl_len()` and `compl_orig_text + get_compl_len()` before passing the resulting pointer to `ins_bytes`. If `get_compl_len()` returns a value greater than the actual length of the `compl_leader` or `compl_orig_text` strings, the resulting pointer will be out-of-bounds. The `ins_bytes` function, which expects a null-terminated string, would then attempt to read from this out-of-bounds memory location until it encounters a null byte. This out-of-bounds read could lead to information disclosure, denial of service (crash), or other unpredictable behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In the Ctrl_E block, `ins_bytes(compl_leader + get_compl_len())` and `ins_bytes(compl_orig_text + get_compl_len())` are called. If `get_compl_len()` returns a value larger than the actual length of the `compl_leader` or `compl_orig_text` strings, the pointer arithmetic will result in an out-of-bounds memory address. `ins_bytes` will then read from this invalid memory location and insert the arbitrary data into the editor's buffer, leading to information disclosure and potential memory corruption or arbitrary code execution."
