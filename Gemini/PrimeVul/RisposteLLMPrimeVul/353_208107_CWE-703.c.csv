"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to write to `pols[1]` within the `CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY` block without verifying if the array pointed to by `pols` has sufficient allocated capacity to hold an additional element. If the caller provides an array with only enough space for `pols[0]` (e.g., `*num_pols` is 1 and the allocated size is 1), this write will result in an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting adjacent memory or leading to a crash. The `(*num_pols)++` operation occurs after the write, indicating an intent to expand the array, but no bounds check is performed prior to the write."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to write to pols[1] if CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY is defined and certain conditions are met. However, the size of the pols array is determined by the initial value of *num_pols. If *num_pols is initially 1, writing to pols[1] would result in an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting adjacent memory or leading to a crash. The increment of *num_pols happens after the write to pols[1], which does not prevent the out-of-bounds access."
