"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and path traversal.","The code performs only a prefix check (strncmp) on the backend_uri to determine the NVRAM backend operations. It does not validate the remainder of the URI string for malicious characters or patterns, such as path traversal sequences like '../'. This allows an attacker to potentially craft a backend_uri that, when processed by the g_nvram_backend_ops->prepare function, could lead to unintended file system access or other resource manipulation, depending on the implementation of the prepare function. This constitutes improper input validation."
"2","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The product reads data past the end of the intended buffer.","The code uses strncmp with fixed lengths (6 and 7) to compare a backend URI. If the backend_uri, obtained from tpmstate_get_backend_uri, is not null-terminated within the specified length or points to a buffer smaller than the comparison length, strncmp will attempt to read past the end of the buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially lead to further exploitation."
