"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The program calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The function attempts to deallocate memory pointed to by 's' using 'gf_free'. If the pointer 's' has already been freed before this function is called, then calling 'gf_free(s)' will result in a double free vulnerability. This can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or a denial of service."

If the pointer 's' has already been freed before this function is called, then calling 'gf_free(s)' will result in a double free vulnerability. This can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or a denial of service."
"4","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program does not release a memory resource before the program terminates or before the memory is no longer needed. This can lead to a gradual consumption of available memory, potentially causing performance degradation or denial of service.","The function frees the GF_Box structure itself but does not free any dynamically allocated members that might be contained within the structure. If GF_Box contains pointers to other dynamically allocated memory, this will result in a memory leak as those internal resources will not be released."
