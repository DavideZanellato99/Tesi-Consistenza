"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not properly handle the error. This typically causes a program crash or exit, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code accesses members of the 'ctx' and 'ctx->rings' structures without performing null pointer checks.
