"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code performs an insufficient size check by comparing the input length with sizeof(bh) (the size of the pointer blobheader *) instead of sizeof(*bh) (the size of the blobheader structure itself). If the provided length is greater than the pointer size but less than the actual blobheader structure size, subsequent accesses to fields within bh (e.g., bh->flags) can result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or a crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains an insufficient bounds check. The condition 'length < sizeof(bh)' compares the input buffer's length with the size of the pointer 'bh' (typically 4 or 8 bytes), rather than the actual size of the 'blobheader' structure it points to. If the provided 'length' is greater than the pointer size but less than the full size of the 'blobheader' structure, the check will pass. Subsequent dereferences of 'bh' to access members like 'bh->totlen', 'bh->min_version', 'bh->version', 'bh->hdrsize', and 'bh->flags' will then attempt to read data beyond the allocated or provided 'data' buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability."
