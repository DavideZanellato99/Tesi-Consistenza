"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, which can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The code does not check if the return value of smack_ipc(ipp) is NULL. If smack_ipc returns NULL, the subsequent dereference *blob will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a system crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit condition that is not properly handled, leading to a denial of service or other consequences.","The code dereferences the pointer 'blob' (via '*blob') and then 'iskp' (via 'iskp->smk_secid') without checking if 'smack_ipc(ipp)' returns a NULL pointer or if the pointer it returns points to a NULL 'smack_known' structure. If either of these conditions occurs, a NULL pointer dereference will happen, leading to a system crash or denial of service."
