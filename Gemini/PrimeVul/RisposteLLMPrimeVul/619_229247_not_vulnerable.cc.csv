"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, causing a crash or exit.","The code performs a dynamic_cast from messages::result_message* to messages::result_message::exception*. If the dynamic_cast fails, it returns a nullptr. This nullptr is then immediately dereferenced using the unary * operator, leading to a null pointer dereference and subsequent undefined behavior, which typically results in a program crash (Denial of Service)."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to point to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically causes a program crash or denial of service.","The code performs a dynamic_cast from messages::result_message* to messages::result_message::exception*. If the msg pointer does not actually point to an object of type messages::result_message::exception or a derived class, dynamic_cast will return nullptr. The code then immediately dereferences the result of the dynamic_cast without checking if it is nullptr. This will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or other undefined behavior if msg is not of the expected type."
