"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code accesses stl->neighbors_start[facet_num] without validating that facet_num is within the bounds of the neighbors_start array. An attacker could provide a malicious facet_num value, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This could result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code snippet is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The `facet_num` parameter, which is an integer, is used as an index to access `stl->neighbors_start` without any prior bounds checking. An attacker could provide a `facet_num` value outside the valid range of the `neighbors_start` array, leading to a read of arbitrary memory locations. This could result in a denial of service (crash) or potentially information disclosure."
