"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, leading to a crash or denial of service.","The code does not check the return values of memory allocation functions `gf_sg_command_new` and `gf_sg_command_field_new`. If these functions fail to allocate memory and return NULL, subsequent attempts to dereference the NULL pointers (e.g., `BM_SetCommandNode(com, node);` or `inf->fieldType = field.fieldType;`) will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a program crash and a denial of service. Additionally, the return value of `gf_sg_vrml_field_pointer_new` is not checked, potentially passing a NULL pointer to `gf_bifs_dec_field` which could also lead to a crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer or before the beginning of the buffer.","An integer underflow occurs when calculating nbBits. If gf_node_get_num_fields_in_mode returns 0, then gf_get_bit_size is called with -1. Assuming gf_get_bit_size takes an unsigned integer, -1 becomes UINT_MAX, causing nbBits to be a large value (e.g., 32 or 64). This large nbBits is then used in gf_bs_read_int(bs, nbBits), leading to an attempt to read an excessive number of bits from the bitstream. This can result in an out-of-bounds read from the bitstream buffer, potentially causing a crash or information disclosure."
