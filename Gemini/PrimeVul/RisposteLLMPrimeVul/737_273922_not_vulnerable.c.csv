"1","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for a condition that is unusual or exceptional, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This can include situations such as a function returning an error code, a resource becoming unavailable, or a system call failing. If these conditions are not properly handled, the product may enter an invalid state, crash, or become vulnerable to other attacks.","The handle_ABOR function sends two messages to the client using send_msg but does not check the return value of send_msg. If send_msg fails (e.g., due to a broken pipe, closed socket, or network error), the server will not detect the failure and will proceed as if the messages were successfully delivered. This can lead to a desynchronization of state between the client and server, where the client might have an incorrect understanding of the connection status, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service."
