"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two numbers is calculated, and the result is stored in a data type that is too small to hold the result, leading to a loss of precision or an unexpected value. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The size of the output tensor 'out' is determined by 'in0.shape()'. If the product of the dimensions within 'in0.shape()' results in an integer overflow, the allocated memory for 'out' will be smaller than required. Subsequently, when 'functor::SimpleBinaryFunctor' attempts to write the computation results into 'out_flat', it may write beyond the bounds of the undersized buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write."

"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The code allocates an output tensor with the shape of in0 and passes in0_flat, in1_flat, and out_flat to a SimpleBinaryFunctor. There is no explicit validation to ensure that in1_flat has a compatible size or shape with in0_flat. If in1_flat is smaller than in0_flat, the functor, likely performing element-wise operations up to the size of out_flat (which is derived from in0_flat), could attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory for in1_flat, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
