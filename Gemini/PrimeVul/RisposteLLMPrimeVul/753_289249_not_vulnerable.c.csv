"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product accesses or dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which is NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code dereferences `substream->runtime` and then `runtime->oss` without checking if `substream` or `substream->runtime` are null. If either pointer is null, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, potentially causing a system crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, typically because the pointer was not assigned to point to a valid block of memory (or was assigned NULL). This typically causes a program crash.","The code does not perform null pointer checks on the 'substream' parameter or its 'runtime' member before dereferencing them. If 'substream' is NULL, accessing 'substream->runtime' will result in a null pointer dereference. Similarly, if 'substream->runtime' is NULL, accessing 'runtime->oss.params' or 'runtime->oss.prepare' will lead to a null pointer dereference, potentially causing a system crash (denial of service) or other undefined behavior in a kernel context."
