"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string that is derived from external input, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.","The Exceptions::fthrow function uses a format string with arguments derived from potentially untrusted input (class and field names). If an attacker can control these names and inject format specifiers, it could lead to a format string vulnerability, allowing arbitrary memory read/write, information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overrun the output buffer. This can occur when using functions like sprintf or strcpy without bounds checking, leading to data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.","The Exceptions::fthrow function constructs an error message using several class and field names. If these names (e.g., ref_klass->external_name(), fd.name()->as_C_string(), sel_klass->external_name()) can be controlled by an attacker and are excessively long, and if the internal buffer used by Exceptions::fthrow for formatting is fixed-size and not adequately protected against overflow, this could lead to a buffer overflow."
