"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The function readUInt expects a 4-byte buffer but does not perform any bounds checking on the input buf. If the caller provides a buffer smaller than 4 bytes, accessing b[1], b[2], or b[3] will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
