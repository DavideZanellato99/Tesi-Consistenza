"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit.","The function pcl_status_read uses the 'data' pointer as the destination for memcpy and dereferences the 'pcs' pointer without checking if either pointer is NULL. If 'data' or 'pcs' is NULL and the conditions for memcpy or dereference are met, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."

"4","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The memcpy call copies 'count' bytes to the 'data' buffer. While 'count' is limited by 'max_data' and the available data in 'pcs->status.buffer', there is no check to ensure that the 'data' buffer, provided by the caller, is large enough to accommodate 'count' bytes. If the caller provides a 'data' buffer that is smaller than 'count', a buffer overflow will occur, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
