"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication or addition, or the result of an integer subtraction, is larger or smaller than the maximum or minimum value that can be stored in the associated data type. This can lead to a wraparound, where the value becomes a very small or very large number, respectively, or an exception.","The TFLITE_DCHECK_LE(shift, 0) assertion ensures that the shift parameter is non-positive. However, debug assertions are often removed in release builds. If this check is absent in a release build and an attacker can supply a positive value for 'shift', the subsequent call to MultiplyByQuantizedMultiplier could perform a left shift operation. A left shift on an int32_t with a positive shift value can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in incorrect calculations or potentially exploitable behavior."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication, addition, or subtraction is greater than the maximum value, or less than the minimum value, for the integer type, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The TFLITE_DCHECK_LE(shift, 0) macro is likely a debug-only assertion that is removed in release builds. In a release build, an attacker could bypass this check and provide a positive 'shift' value. If the underlying MultiplyByQuantizedMultiplier function interprets a positive 'shift' as a left shift operation, this could lead to an integer overflow, especially if the intermediate product of 'x' and 'quantized_multiplier' is large. This behavior would also contradict the function's name 'MultiplyByQuantizedMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp', which implies a reduction in magnitude (right shift or no shift)."
