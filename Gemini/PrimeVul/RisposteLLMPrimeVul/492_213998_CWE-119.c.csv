"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs concurrent actions on a shared resource without properly synchronizing the actions. This can lead to a race condition, where the outcome depends on the unpredictable timing of the actions, potentially resulting in data corruption, unexpected behavior, or denial of service.","The function FindEmptyObjectSlot attempts to find and initialize an empty object slot in a shared array s_objects without any synchronization mechanisms. If multiple threads call this function concurrently, a race condition can occur where two or more threads might identify the same slot as empty (object->attributes.occupied == CLEAR) before any thread has a chance to mark it as occupied or fully initialize it. This can lead to multiple threads believing they have successfully acquired the same object slot, resulting in data corruption, incorrect state management, or other unpredictable behavior when the object is subsequently used."

"3","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Access to Resource without Proper Synchronization","The product performs a concurrent access to a shared resource without enforcing mutual exclusion. This can lead to a race condition where multiple threads or processes attempt to modify the same resource simultaneously, resulting in data corruption, unexpected behavior, or denial of service.","The FindEmptyObjectSlot function is vulnerable to a race condition. It attempts to find and allocate an empty object slot from a shared global array s_objects by checking object->attributes.occupied == CLEAR. However, there is no synchronization mechanism to protect the s_objects array or the occupied flag during this check and subsequent allocation. Multiple threads calling this function concurrently can race, leading to two or more threads finding and attempting to allocate the same slot. Additionally, the MemorySet call initializes object->attributes to all zeros. If object->attributes.occupied is part of OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES and CLEAR is defined as zero, the slot's occupied flag will remain CLEAR after initialization, making it appear available again immediately and allowing multiple callers to acquire and use the same object slot, leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior."
