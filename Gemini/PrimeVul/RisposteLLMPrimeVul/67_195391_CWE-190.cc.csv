"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a maximum size. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other weaknesses.","The code calculates the total number of ngrams by accumulating values into `ngrams_splits_data`. If `SPLITS_TYPE` is a fixed-size integer type (e.g., `int32`) and the cumulative sum of `num_ngrams` exceeds its maximum representable value, an integer overflow will occur. This overflow can cause `ngrams_splits_data[num_batch_items]` to wrap around to a smaller, potentially positive, value. This smaller value is then used to allocate the `ngrams` tensor, resulting in an undersized buffer. Subsequent calls to `CreateNgrams` will write past the allocated buffer boundaries, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The code calculates the total number of n-grams by accumulating `num_ngrams` into `ngrams_splits_data`. If `SPLITS_TYPE` is a fixed-size integer type (e.g., `int`), and the total number of n-grams across all batch items exceeds its maximum representable value, an integer overflow (CWE-190) will occur. This overflow results in `ngrams_splits_data[num_batch_items]` holding an incorrect, smaller-than-expected value. This undersized value is then used to allocate the `ngrams` output tensor. During the subsequent loop, the `output_start_idx` (which tracks the write position) will eventually exceed the bounds of the undersized `ngrams` tensor, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) when `CreateNgrams` attempts to write data. This can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."
