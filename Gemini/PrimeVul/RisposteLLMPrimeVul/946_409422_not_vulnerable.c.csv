"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to a valid memory location. This typically causes a program crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The function term_get_bg_color dereferences the input pointers r, g, and b without checking if they are NULL. If a caller passes a NULL pointer for any of these arguments and the condition rbg_status.tr_progress == STATUS_GOT is met, the program will attempt to write to an invalid memory location, leading to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior."
