"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be non-NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code retrieves a NetClientState pointer nc using qemu_get_queue(s->nic) but does not check if nc is null before dereferencing nc->info. If qemu_get_queue returns null, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, which can lead to a crash or an exit condition that allows for a denial of service.","The code retrieves a NetClientState pointer using qemu_get_queue(s->nic). If qemu_get_queue returns NULL, the subsequent access to nc->info within the if block (nc->info->receive) will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or denial of service.
