"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code explicitly sets a newly connected socket to blocking mode using g_socket_set_blocking(data->socket, TRUE); despite being in an asynchronous I/O context. The accompanying comment 'wrong, but backward compatible' indicates this is a known design flaw. In an asynchronous application, performing blocking I/O operations on the main thread can cause the entire application to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service if an attacker can control the remote server to delay responses indefinitely."

"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation or consumption of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code explicitly sets a socket to blocking mode (g_socket_set_blocking(data->socket, TRUE);) within an asynchronous callback function. This is acknowledged by the comment 'wrong, but backward compatible'. In an asynchronous I/O framework like GLib, performing blocking operations can cause the main event loop to halt or become unresponsive while waiting for the blocking operation to complete. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) where the application becomes unresponsive to user input or other network events, effectively preventing legitimate users from interacting with the application. An attacker who can trigger a slow or hanging I/O operation on this socket could exploit this to render the application unusable."
