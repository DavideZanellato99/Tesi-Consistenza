"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code contains an off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability. The `line` buffer is declared with `TEMP_BUF_SIZE`. After copying data into `line`, the `llen` variable represents the total length of the data. The code then attempts to null-terminate the string using `line[llen + 1] = '\0';`. Due to prior length adjustments, `llen` can be `TEMP_BUF_SIZE - 1`, which causes `line[TEMP_BUF_SIZE]` to be written, one byte beyond the allocated boundary of the `line` buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The LOCAL_ARRAY(char, line, TEMP_BUF_SIZE) buffer is used to store processed lines. After copying data into this buffer, the code attempts to null-terminate the string with line[llen + 1] = '\0';. The variable 'llen' represents the total number of bytes copied into the 'line' buffer. If 'llen' is equal to TEMP_BUF_SIZE - 1 (meaning the buffer is completely filled with data), then line[llen + 1] attempts to write a null byte at line[TEMP_BUF_SIZE], which is one byte beyond the allocated boundary of the 'line' buffer. This out-of-bounds write can corrupt adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to denial of service (crashes) or, in some circumstances, arbitrary code execution. There is no check to ensure that the combined length of data being copied into 'line' (either 'llen' or 'gopherState->len + llen') does not exceed TEMP_BUF_SIZE - 1 before the null terminator is added."
