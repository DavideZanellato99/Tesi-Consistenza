"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The program does not properly synchronize concurrent access to a shared resource, leading to a race condition. This can result in unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or denial of service if multiple threads or processes attempt to modify the resource simultaneously without proper locking mechanisms.","The code performs a write operation (Copy) on a shared tensor (old_unlocked_lhs) after the mutex lock protecting it has been released. Specifically, the mutex_lock l(*context->input_ref_mutex(0)) goes out of scope before the final Copy(context, &old_unlocked_lhs, rhs) call, which is executed when use_exclusive_lock_ is false. This creates a race condition where another thread could concurrently access or modify the shared tensor while it is being written to, potentially leading to data corruption, inconsistent state, or other unpredictable behavior."

"3","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs operations on a shared resource in an order that can be influenced by an external actor, leading to a race condition. This can result in unexpected behavior, data corruption, or denial of service.","The code exhibits a race condition. The final Copy operation is performed outside of the mutex_lock. If use_exclusive_lock_ is false, the Copy function operates on a tensor obtained via context->mutable_input(0, /* lock_held */ false). Between the release of the mutex and the completion of the Copy, another thread could acquire the lock and call context->replace_ref_input(0, ...) to change the underlying tensor that input(0) refers to.
