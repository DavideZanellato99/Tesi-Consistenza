"1","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","The program calculates or uses an array index or buffer offset that is one less or one greater than the intended value, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or unintended information disclosure. The error can be in the calculation of the maximum array index, the number of iterations in a loop, or the size of a buffer.","The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to an off-by-one error when processing the string in the loop. The input length 'len' is used to allocate the buffer and is also the loop limit for reading the data. The loop iterates using 'i' up to 'len' (i < len) in steps of 2, performing a compression operation by copying 'name[i]' to 'name[i/2]'. The final null terminator is placed at 'name[i/2]' outside the loop. If 'len' is an odd number, the loop exits with 'i' being equal to 'len + 1'. The final null termination 'name[i/2] = '\\0'' can write one byte past the allocated memory boundary of the compressed string, causing a buffer overflow when 'len' is odd and greater than 1."
