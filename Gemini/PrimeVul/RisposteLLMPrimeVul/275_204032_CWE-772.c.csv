"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end or before the beginning of the buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code accesses skb->data to read pkt_type without first verifying that skb->len is at least 1. If skb->len is 0, dereferencing skb->data will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or information leak."
