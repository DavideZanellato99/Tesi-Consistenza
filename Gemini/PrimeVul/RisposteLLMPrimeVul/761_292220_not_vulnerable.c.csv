"1","True","CWE-134","Uncontrolled Format String","The product uses a user-controlled format string in a formatted output routine, which can lead to an information leak, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code passes user-controlled strings such as 'reason', 'user', 'chan', and 'ip' directly to functions and macros like EMIT_SIGNAL_TIMESTAMP without prior sanitization or validation. If EMIT_SIGNAL_TIMESTAMP internally uses a printf-like function and passes one of these user-controlled strings directly as the format argument (e.g., printf(reason);), it creates an Uncontrolled Format String vulnerability. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically causes a program crash or an unhandled exception, leading to a denial of service.","The code dereferences the 'reason' pointer at 'if (*reason)' and the 'tags_data' pointer at 'tags_data->timestamp' without prior null checks. If either 'reason' or 'tags_data' is a null pointer, this will lead to a segmentation fault and a denial of service."
