"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet iterates through two vectors of strings, calling helper functions for each element and returning early if any helper function indicates an error. This pattern is robust and does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or race conditions within this snippet's scope. The security of the overall system would depend on the implementation of `RemoveFunctionHelper` and `RemoveGradient`, and how the returned Status object is handled by the caller."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet demonstrates a standard pattern for iterating through collections and performing operations, with proper error checking and early exit on failure.

The actual vulnerability, if any, would likely reside within the implementation of RemoveFunctionHelper or RemoveGradient, or in how the input vectors are populated, which is outside the scope of this snippet."
