"1","True","CWE-1336","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Representation (Hash Collisions)","The product uses a hash function that is susceptible to collisions, allowing an attacker to craft inputs that produce the same hash value. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) by causing hash table lookups to degrade to O(N) complexity, or other security impacts depending on the context.","The hash function truncates the calculated hash value by applying h &= LONG_MAX;. This operation significantly reduces the effective hash space, especially if unsigned long is wider than long or if it clears the most significant bit, increasing the probability of hash collisions. If this hash function is used in a hash table, an attacker could craft inputs that result in numerous collisions, degrading the performance of hash table operations to worst-case O(N) complexity, leading to a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be controlled by an actor. This can lead to an attacker causing a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting the available resources.","The provided code implements a simple polynomial hash function. While suitable for general-purpose use, this type of hash is not cryptographically secure and is susceptible to collision attacks. If this hash function is used in a security-sensitive context, such as for hash tables storing untrusted input, an attacker could craft malicious inputs that generate a large number of hash collisions. This could degrade the performance of the hash table to its worst-case scenario, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming excessive CPU resources. The final operation h &= LONG_MAX; reduces the effective hash space, which could further increase the probability of collisions."
