"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","A double free vulnerability occurs when a program calls free() twice on the same memory address. After the first free(), the memory region is added to the list of available memory. If the program frees the same memory region again, it can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution, as the memory management system might try to free an already freed or reallocated block, or an attacker might manipulate the freed chunk.","The code contains a double-free vulnerability. The 'buffer' and 'path' variables are freed within an 'if' block if an error occurs during buffer population or packet writing. Regardless of whether this 'if' block is entered, 'buffer' and 'path' are freed again immediately after the block, leading to a double-free if the error condition was met."
"2","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a double-free vulnerability. The ssh_buffer_free(buffer) and ssh_string_free(path) functions are called unconditionally after an if block where they might have already been called. If any of the conditions within the if statement (buffer_add_u32, buffer_add_ssh_string, buffer_add_attributes, or sftp_packet_write failing) are met, the buffer and path are freed. Subsequently, they are freed again outside the if block, leading to a double-free condition."
