"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product shares a resource across multiple concurrently executing components without enforcing proper synchronization. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or denial of service if the components access the resource in an interleaved manner.","The code temporarily modifies the buffer returned by ml_get_curline() by inserting a null terminator to trim trailing whitespace, and then restores the original character. If ml_get_curline() returns a pointer to a shared buffer that can be accessed concurrently by other threads or processes, this temporary modification without proper synchronization could lead to a race condition, causing other components to read an incorrectly truncated line before the original character is restored."
