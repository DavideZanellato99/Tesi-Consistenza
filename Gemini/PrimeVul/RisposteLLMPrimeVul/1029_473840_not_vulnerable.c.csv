"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","A null pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, typically because it has not been initialized or has been explicitly set to null. This often leads to a program crash or denial of service.","The code dereferences the 's' pointer without checking if it is null. If 's' is a null pointer, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid memory address, often resulting in a crash or exit of the application. This can lead to a denial of service or other unpredictable behavior.","The code dereferences the 's' pointer using '*s' without checking if 's' is a NULL pointer. If 's' is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or segmentation fault. This vulnerability can be exploited for a Denial of Service."
