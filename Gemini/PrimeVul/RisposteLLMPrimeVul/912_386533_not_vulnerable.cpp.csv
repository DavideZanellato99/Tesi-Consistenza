"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","The product accesses memory that has been freed. This can lead to a crash or to arbitrary code execution.","The code allocates memory for a filename (f), copies the input file path into it, and then passes this buffer to the DL_WriterA constructor. Immediately after the DL_WriterA object is constructed, the allocated memory for 'f' is deallocated using delete[]. If the DL_WriterA object stores a pointer to this filename buffer internally without making its own deep copy, then the object will hold a dangling pointer. Any subsequent attempt to access the filename through this dangling pointer via the returned DL_WriterA object will result in a use-after-free vulnerability, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential arbitrary code execution."
