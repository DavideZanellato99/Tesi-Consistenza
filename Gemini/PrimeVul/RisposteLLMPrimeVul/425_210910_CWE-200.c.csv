"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code constructs a status line string in NameBuff. The variable 'len' tracks the current length of the string. The line '*(p + len++) = ' '; ' writes a space character and then increments 'len'. If 'len' is 'MAXPATHL - 1' before this operation, it writes to the last valid byte of NameBuff and then increments 'len' to 'MAXPATHL'. Subsequently, 'vim_snprintf' is called with '(char *)p + len' as the destination buffer, which evaluates to '(char *)NameBuff + MAXPATHL'. This pointer is one byte past the end of the NameBuff array, leading to an out-of-bounds pointer access. Passing an out-of-bounds pointer to 'vim_snprintf' (even with a size of 0) results in undefined behavior, which can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet appears to handle string manipulations and buffer operations carefully. It uses vim_snprintf with explicit size limits (MAXPATHL - len) to prevent buffer overflows when appending strings to NameBuff. The 'len' variable is consistently updated to reflect the current length of the string in the buffer, ensuring that subsequent writes do not exceed the allocated space. Display-related truncations are also handled with checks and in-place modifications that do not lead to out-of-bounds writes. The recursion guard 'busy' prevents re-entrant calls. No obvious format string vulnerabilities, integer overflows, or race conditions are present in the provided snippet."
