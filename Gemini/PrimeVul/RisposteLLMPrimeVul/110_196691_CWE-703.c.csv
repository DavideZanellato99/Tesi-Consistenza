"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code uses memcpy to copy data from ch->sample->data to a newly allocated buffer. While the destination buffer 'data' is allocated with ch->sample->dataLength, there is no explicit check to ensure that the source buffer ch->sample->data is at least ch->sample->dataLength bytes long. If ch->sample->dataLength is derived from untrusted input (e.g., a malformed media file) and is larger than the actual allocated size of ch->sample->data, this will result in an out-of-bounds read from ch->sample->data, potentially leading to a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs a memcpy operation using ch->sample->data as the source and ch->sample->dataLength as the size. The destination buffer data is allocated with ch->sample->dataLength, so the write operation itself is safe. However, if ch->sample->dataLength (which is likely derived from untrusted input like a media file) is greater than the actual allocated size of the buffer pointed to by ch->sample->data, then the memcpy will attempt to read beyond the bounds of ch->sample->data. This constitutes an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure, crashes, or other undefined behavior. The functions isor_reader_get_sample or isor_reader_get_sample_from_item are responsible for populating ch->sample and its associated data and length, and if they do not sufficiently validate these values against the actual buffer allocation, this vulnerability can be triggered."
