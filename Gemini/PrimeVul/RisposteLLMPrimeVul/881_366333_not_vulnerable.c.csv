"1","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs two or more operations on a shared resource without enforcing proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition where the order of operations is not guaranteed, potentially resulting in data corruption, unexpected behavior, or denial of service.","The code iterates over a shared list (mnt->mnt_mounts) without any explicit synchronization mechanism (e.g., spinlocks or RCU). If another thread concurrently modifies this list (e.g., adds, removes, or frees a struct mount entry), it can lead to a race condition. This could result in a Use-After-Free vulnerability if a child mount is freed while being accessed, or lead to list corruption, incorrect results, or a kernel panic."

"3","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The program does not properly synchronize concurrent access to a shared resource.

In a concurrent environment, if another thread modifies this list by removing or freeing a child entry while this function is iterating, it could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability when child->mnt_mountpoint or child->mnt.mnt_flags is accessed.
