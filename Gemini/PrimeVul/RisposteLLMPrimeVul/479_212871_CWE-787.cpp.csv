"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is executed.","The code constructs a command string (cmdline) using bookmark_cmd from configuration and user-controlled parameters like url, title, description, and feed_title. This cmdline is then executed directly via /bin/sh -c or utils::run_interactively. The bookmark_cmd is inserted without any sanitization or quoting, allowing direct command injection if an attacker can control the configuration. The url parameter's sanitization (utils::replace_all(url,""'"", ""%27"")) is insufficient as it only replaces single quotes and does not prevent injection of other shell metacharacters (e.g., $(id), &&, ;). This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the application."

"5","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component for execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.","The code constructs a shell command string using user-supplied or configuration-derived inputs (URL, title, description, feed_title, and the bookmark command itself) and then executes it via `/bin/sh -c`. Although some sanitization attempts are made (e.g., replacing single quotes in the URL, using `stfl::quote` for other fields), these are often insufficient to prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary shell commands by carefully crafting input that bypasses the sanitization, leading to OS command injection. An attacker could manipulate these inputs to execute arbitrary commands on the system."
