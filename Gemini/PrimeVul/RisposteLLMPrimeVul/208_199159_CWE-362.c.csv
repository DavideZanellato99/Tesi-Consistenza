"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code calculates a size value using division by 'width'. The 'width' variable is obtained from 'snd_pcm_format_physical_width(format)'. If the 'format' variable, which is derived from 'runtime->oss.format', is invalid or can be manipulated to a value that causes 'snd_pcm_format_physical_width' to return 0, a division-by-zero error will occur. In a kernel context, this typically leads to a kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service condition."

"4","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition. This typically occurs when the divisor is a variable that is not properly validated to ensure it is non-zero before the division operation.","The code calculates 'width' using 'snd_pcm_format_physical_width(format)'. The 'format' variable is derived from 'runtime->oss.format' via 'snd_pcm_oss_format_from'. If 'runtime->oss.format' is an invalid or unhandled value, 'snd_pcm_oss_format_from' can return 'SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_UNKNOWN'. In such cases, 'snd_pcm_format_physical_width' typically returns 0. This zero value for 'width' is then used as a divisor in two calculations: 'size = (8 * (runtime->oss.period_bytes - runtime->oss.buffer_used) + 7) / width;' and 'size * 8 / width;'. An attacker who can control 'runtime->oss.format' (e.g., through a malicious IOCTL) can trigger a division-by-zero error, leading to a kernel panic and a denial of service."
