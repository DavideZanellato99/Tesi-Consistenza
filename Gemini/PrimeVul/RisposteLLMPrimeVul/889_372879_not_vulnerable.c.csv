"1","True","CWE-170","Improper Null Termination","The product does not properly terminate a string or array with a null character, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads or other memory corruption issues.","The strncpy function used to copy the name string into notify.name does not guarantee null-termination if the source string is longer than or equal to NOTIFY_MAX_NAME. If name is exactly NOTIFY_MAX_NAME characters long, notify.name will not be null-terminated. This can lead to buffer over-reads when notify.name is later processed as a null-terminated string, potentially causing information leaks or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the out-of-bounds data is used to control program flow.","The strncpy function copies the name string into notify.name with a maximum length of NOTIFY_MAX_NAME. If the source string name has a length greater than or equal to NOTIFY_MAX_NAME, strncpy will copy NOTIFY_MAX_NAME bytes but will not null-terminate the notify.name buffer. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if notify.name is subsequently treated as a null-terminated string, potentially causing information disclosure or a denial of service."
