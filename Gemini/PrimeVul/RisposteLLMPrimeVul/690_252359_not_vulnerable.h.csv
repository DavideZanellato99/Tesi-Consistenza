"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles memory allocation and deallocation for `pComp` by ensuring `MZ_FREE(pComp)` is called on all execution paths, preventing memory leaks. It also performs initial validation for `pBuf` and `pPut_buf_func` parameters. No obvious memory leaks, double frees, use-after-frees, or null pointer dereferences are present within this specific function's logic. Potential vulnerabilities would reside in the external functions `tdefl_init`, `tdefl_compress_buffer`, or `tdefl_put_buf_func_ptr` which are not part of this snippet."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly allocates memory for the tdefl_compressor structure using MZ_MALLOC, checks if the allocation was successful, uses the allocated memory for initialization and compression, and then unconditionally frees the memory using MZ_FREE before returning. This robust memory management prevents memory leaks and use-after-free vulnerabilities within the scope of this function. Input parameters pBuf and pPut_buf_func are also validated."
