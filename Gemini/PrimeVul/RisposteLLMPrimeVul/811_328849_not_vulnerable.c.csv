"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code uses printf with the %s format specifier to print field->name, field->descriptor, and field->flags_str. If these pointers do not point to valid null-terminated strings or point to memory outside of allocated buffers, printf will attempt to read beyond the intended memory region, leading to a buffer over-read vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code dereferences field->name, field->descriptor, and field->flags_str within printf statements without checking if these pointers are NULL. If any of these member pointers are NULL, the %s format specifier will attempt to read from an invalid memory address, leading to a segmentation fault or program crash. Although the field pointer itself is checked for NULL, its constituent string pointers are not validated before use."
