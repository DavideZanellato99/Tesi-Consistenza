"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code accesses elements of the explicit_paddings vector at indices 2, 3, 4, and 5 without checking if the vector contains enough elements. If explicit_paddings.size() is less than 6, this will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash, information disclosure, or corrupted program state."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location outside of the intended bounds of the buffer.","The code accesses elements of the `explicit_paddings` vector at indices 2, 3, 4, and 5 without first verifying that the vector contains at least 6 elements. If `explicit_paddings.size()` is less than 6, these accesses will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to undefined behavior such as crashes or potentially information disclosure. Additionally, a division-by-zero error can occur if `filter.dim_size(2)` is zero when calculating `num_groups`, causing a program crash. Integer truncation is also possible when `int64_t` padding values are cast to `int` without range checks."
