"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer or before the beginning of the buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. When processing opcodes like OP_MARK, OP_COMMIT_ARG, OP_PRUNE_ARG, OP_THEN_ARG, and OP_SKIP_ARG, the code reads cc[1] to determine the length of the following data. If the bytecode is malformed and one of these opcodes is placed such that cc + 1 points beyond the end of the allocated buffer (ccend), an out-of-bounds read will occur. This can lead to information disclosure, crashes, or unpredictable behavior."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. In several cases, particularly for opcodes like OP_MARK, OP_COMMIT_ARG, OP_PRUNE_ARG, OP_THEN_ARG, OP_SKIP_ARG, OP_CLASS, OP_NCLASS, OP_XCLASS, and OP_COND, the pointer 'cc' is advanced or used with an offset (e.g., 'cc[1]' or 'GET(cc, 1)') that is read directly from the bytecode without sufficient validation against the 'ccend' boundary. If an attacker can control the bytecode, they can provide a large value for this offset, causing 'cc' or an intermediate pointer like 'alternative' to point beyond the allocated buffer. Subsequent dereferences of such pointers would then result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash (Denial of Service) or potential information disclosure."
