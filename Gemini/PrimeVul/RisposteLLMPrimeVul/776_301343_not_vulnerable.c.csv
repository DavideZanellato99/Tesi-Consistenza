"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, which can lead to a crash or an arbitrary read/write.","The code does not check if 'fsp' or 'fsp->fh' are NULL before dereferencing them to access 'fsp->fh->fd'. If either pointer is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code directly dereferences the 'fsp' pointer and its 'fh' member without checking if they are NULL.
