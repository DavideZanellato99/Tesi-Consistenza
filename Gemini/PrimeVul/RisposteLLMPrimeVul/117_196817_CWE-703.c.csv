"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after it has been allocated and is no longer needed. This can lead to a gradual consumption of system resources, potentially causing denial-of-service or other stability issues.","The code contains a memory leak. If the njs_object_property_add function fails (e.g., due to memory allocation issues) and returns NULL at any point during the loop, the function immediately returns NJS_ERROR. In this error path, the memory allocated for array->start is not freed, leading to a persistent memory leak. The njs_mp_free call for array->start is only reached if the loop completes successfully."

"4","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates an excessive quantity of resources, such as memory or CPU, without any limits or throttling, which can be exploited by an attacker to consume all available resources and cause a denial of service.","The code iterates 'length' times, calling 'njs_object_property_add' in each iteration. If 'length' is controlled by an attacker and can be arbitrarily large, this can lead to excessive memory allocation for object properties. While individual allocation failures are checked, the cumulative effect of numerous allocations can exhaust available memory, resulting in a denial-of-service condition for the application or system. There are no explicit limits or throttling mechanisms to prevent an attacker from requesting an extremely large number of properties."
