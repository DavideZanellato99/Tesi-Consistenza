"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously freed, or that has not been assigned, or that has been assigned to NULL.","The function iwl_pcie_apm_stop dereferences the 'trans' pointer multiple times (e.g., trans->status, trans->trans_cfg, trans->cfg) without checking if it is a NULL pointer. If a NULL pointer is passed as 'trans', this will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a system crash and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, which can lead to a crash or an arbitrary write.","The code dereferences 'trans->trans_cfg' and 'trans->cfg' without checking if these pointers are NULL. Specifically, 'trans->trans_cfg->device_family', 'trans->trans_cfg->csr->flag_init_done', and 'trans->cfg->lp_xtal_workaround' are accessed. If 'trans->trans_cfg' or 'trans->cfg' is NULL at runtime, these dereferences will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, likely causing a system crash (kernel panic) and resulting in a Denial of Service."
