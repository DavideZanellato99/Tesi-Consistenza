"1","True","CWE-74","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')","The product constructs a string or sequence of commands using external input from a downstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended logic or behavior of the downstream component. This can lead to various forms of injection attacks, such as command injection, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting, depending on the context and the downstream component's interpretation of the special elements.","The code directly uses user-controlled input strings (devname, mountpoint) when populating the mntent structure, which is then written to the system's mount table file (/etc/mtab) via addmntent. If these input strings contain special characters such as spaces, newlines, or shell metacharacters, and the addmntent function does not properly escape or quote these characters when writing to the file, an attacker could inject additional fields or malform existing entries in /etc/mtab. This could lead to a denial of service by corrupting the mount table, or potentially command injection if other privileged tools parse the malformed mtab entries and execute commands based on them without proper sanitization. The code relies on the addmntent function to handle these special characters safely, but without explicit sanitization or validation of devname and mountpoint before assignment, a vulnerability exists if addmntent is not robust against such inputs."

If an attacker provides input containing newline characters ('\n') in `devname` or `mountpoint`, these newlines will be written directly into `/etc/mtab`. This can lead to file injection, where an attacker can create malformed entries or inject arbitrary new mount entries into the system's mount table, potentially causing denial of service or privilege escalation if other tools process these injected entries."
