"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","Refers to the use of memory after it has been freed. This can lead to a program crash, corruption of valid data, or the execution of arbitrary code.","The code exhibits a Use-After-Free vulnerability. The 'mixer' pointer is deleted early in the destructor. Subsequently, within the 'if (player)' block, the code attempts to dereference the already freed 'mixer' pointer to call methods like 'isActive()' and 'isDeviceRemoved()'. This can lead to a program crash, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."

"4","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","The product accesses memory that has been freed. This can lead to a crash, corruption of data, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to dereference the 'mixer' pointer (e.g., calling mixer->isActive()) after it has potentially been deleted in a preceding block, leading to a use-after-free condition. If 'mixer' was not null, it is deleted, and then later accessed within the 'if (player)' block, resulting in undefined behavior."
