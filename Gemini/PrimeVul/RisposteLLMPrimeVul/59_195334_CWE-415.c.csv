"1","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates resources based on an untrusted input, but it does not limit or throttle the allocation, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code reads item_count and extent_count directly from the input bitstream without any validation or upper bounds. These values are then used to control loops that allocate memory for GF_ItemLocationEntry and GF_ItemExtentEntry structures. An attacker can provide maliciously large values for item_count and extent_count, leading to excessive memory allocation and CPU consumption, which can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting system resources."
"2","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates an excessive amount of memory or other resources, or it continues to allocate resources without checking for limits, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code reads item_count and extent_count directly from the input bitstream, which are then used to control the number of iterations in nested loops. Inside these loops, memory is allocated using gf_malloc for GF_ItemLocationEntry and GF_ItemExtentEntry structures. An attacker can provide excessively large values for item_count (up to UINT32_MAX) and extent_count (up to UINT16_MAX), leading to an attempt to allocate a huge amount of memory. This uncontrolled memory allocation can exhaust system resources, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application or the entire system. Although individual gf_malloc calls are checked for failure, this only prevents crashes but does not mitigate the resource exhaustion attack itself."
