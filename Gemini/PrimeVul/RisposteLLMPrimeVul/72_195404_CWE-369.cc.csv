"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code iterates over the batch dimension using `input_size[0]` in the outer loop `for (int64_t b = 0; b < input_size[0]; ++b)`. However, the output tensor's batch dimension `output_size[0]` is calculated as `std::floor(input_size[0] / pooling_ratio_[0])`, which can be smaller than `input_size[0]` if `pooling_ratio_[0]` is greater than 1. This mismatch allows the loop variable `b` to exceed the valid batch index for the `out_mat` Eigen map, leading to an out-of-bounds write when `out_mat.col(out_offset)` is accessed. Specifically, `out_offset` is calculated as `(b * output_size[1] + hs) * output_size[2] + ws`. If `b` becomes greater than or equal to `output_size[0]`, the calculated `out_offset` will point beyond the allocated memory for `output_tensor`, resulting in a heap buffer overflow."
