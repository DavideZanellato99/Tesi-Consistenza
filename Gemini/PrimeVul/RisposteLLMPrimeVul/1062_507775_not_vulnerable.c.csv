"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to a memory leak or other issues.","The function modifies the caller-provided `*out` pointer by advancing it by `buf_len` bytes if the buffer was not allocated by the function itself. If the caller passed a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer, the original starting address of that buffer is lost upon return, preventing the caller from properly freeing the memory. This results in a memory leak."

"3","True","CWE-682","Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments","The program calls a function with arguments that are not specified correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This can include passing incorrect values, using the wrong data types, or providing arguments that violate the function's expected contract or preconditions.","The function incorrectly modifies the caller-provided output buffer pointer *out by incrementing it by buf_len when the buffer was supplied by the caller. This causes *out to point past the end of the data written into the buffer, which can lead to memory corruption, out-of-bounds read/write vulnerabilities, or incorrect memory deallocation if the caller attempts to use the modified pointer."
