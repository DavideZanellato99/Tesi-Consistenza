"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs a memcpy operation using a fixed size (sizeof(struct capability_mp_data)) to copy data from the network buffer. However, the preceding bounds check `if ((pnt + hdr->length + 3) > end)` only verifies that `hdr->length` bytes are available after the capability header. If the value of `hdr->length` (which is controlled by an attacker) is less than `sizeof(struct capability_mp_data)`, the `memcpy` will attempt to read more bytes than are actually present in the capability data, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service (crashes), or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code performs a memcpy operation using a fixed size (sizeof(struct capability_mp_data)) to copy data into the 'mpc' structure. However, the preceding boundary check 'if ((pnt + hdr->length + 3) > end)' only validates that the declared capability data length (hdr->length) plus the header bytes do not exceed the overall message buffer. If 'hdr->length' is less than 'sizeof(struct capability_mp_data)', the memcpy will read past the end of the actual capability data, potentially accessing data from subsequent capabilities or uninitialized memory. This constitutes an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure or a denial of service if the read attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer."
