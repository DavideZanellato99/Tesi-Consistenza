"1","True","CWE-195","Signed-to-Unsigned Conversion Error","The product converts a signed integer to an unsigned integer, but the signed integer has a negative value, which causes the unsigned integer to wrap around to a large positive value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as out-of-bounds array access or incorrect loop iterations.","The code retrieves an index as an 'int' from user input and then implicitly converts it to 'std::size_t'. If a negative integer is provided as input, it will be converted to a very large positive 'std::size_t' value due to signed-to-unsigned conversion rules. This large index is then used in 'buf->Peek(index, &tuple)', which can lead to an out-of-bounds read from the buffer, potentially causing a crash (denial of service) or information disclosure."
