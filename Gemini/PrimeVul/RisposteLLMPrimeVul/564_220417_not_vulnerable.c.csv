"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory address and still contains a NULL value. This typically leads to a crash or denial of service, but in some cases, it can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.","The mrb_ary_concat function retrieves a pointer to an RArray structure from the other mrb_value using mrb_ary_ptr(other). The mrb_ary_ptr macro performs a type check and returns NULL if other is not an array. However, the code then directly passes this potentially NULL pointer (a2) to the ary_concat function without checking if a2 is NULL. If ary_concat attempts to dereference a2 without its own NULL check, this will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash (e.g., segmentation fault) and a denial of service. A robust implementation would check if a2 is NULL and raise a type error or handle the invalid input gracefully."
