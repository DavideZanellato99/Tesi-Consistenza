"1","True","CWE-170","Improper Null Termination","The software does not properly null terminate a string or other data structure, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads or other memory corruption issues when the data is later processed by functions that expect null termination.","The code uses vim_strncpy(buf, fname, len - 1) to copy a string. If the source string 'fname' is longer than or equal to 'len - 1' characters, and if vim_strncpy behaves like the standard strncpy function, the destination buffer 'buf' will not be null-terminated. This can lead to subsequent operations that expect null termination reading past the allocated buffer, potentially causing information disclosure, crashes, or other memory corruption issues."

"5","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer. This can occur when the size of the input buffer is not validated against the size of the output buffer, or when a function that assumes a fixed-size buffer (e.g., PATH_MAX) is used with a smaller, user-controlled buffer.","The function `mch_FullName` is called with an output buffer `buf` and its size `len`. If `mch_FullName` internally uses a function like `realpath` (common for full path resolution on Unix-like systems) and passes `buf` to it, `realpath` assumes the buffer is at least `PATH_MAX` bytes long. If the provided `len` is less than `PATH_MAX`, `realpath` will write past the end of `buf`, leading to a buffer overflow."
