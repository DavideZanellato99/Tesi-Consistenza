"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The PQconnectdb function directly uses the conninfo string without any explicit validation or sanitization. If conninfo is derived from untrusted input, an attacker could manipulate connection parameters such as host, port, database, user, or specific PostgreSQL options. This could lead to connecting to an unintended server, using different credentials, or injecting malicious options that might result in information disclosure or other security impacts, depending on the underlying PQconnectStart function and the PostgreSQL server's interpretation."

"3","True","CWE-200","Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor","The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.","The PQconnectdb function processes a conninfo string that frequently contains sensitive information like database credentials. The snippet directly passes this string to PQconnectStart without any explicit validation or sanitization of its content or source. This lack of protective measures means that if the conninfo string is sourced insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, read from an unencrypted file, exposed in process lists) or if the resulting PGconn object is later mishandled, sensitive information can be exposed to unauthorized actors. The function itself does not mitigate these common information disclosure risks, making it a potential point of vulnerability."
