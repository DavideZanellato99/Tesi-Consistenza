"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple initialization function that assigns global variables. It does not involve user input, dynamic memory allocation, complex logic, or operations that could directly lead to common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or race conditions. The potential for vulnerabilities would depend on the definition and usage of the assigned variables and functions elsewhere in the codebase, which is outside the scope of this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet performs simple assignments of global or static variables. There are no direct user inputs, memory allocations, loops, arithmetic operations, or string manipulations that could introduce common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free. The snippet itself does not contain any discernible security flaws."
