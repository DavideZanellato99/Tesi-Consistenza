"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code uses a user-controlled parameter `conn->keepalives_idle` to set the TCP keepalive idle time. Although negative values are clamped to zero, there is no upper bound validation on this parameter. An attacker controlling this input could specify an extremely large idle time, causing connections to remain open and consume server resources for an excessive duration, leading to a denial-of-service condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption."
