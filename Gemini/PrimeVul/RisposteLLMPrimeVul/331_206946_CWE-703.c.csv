"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code calls the `addopt` function with a fixed-size buffer (e.g., `cmdopts->inoptsbuf`), a size limit (`OPTSMAX`), and user-controlled input (`jas_optarg`). The implementation of `addopt` is not provided. If `addopt` does not properly validate the length of `jas_optarg` against `OPTSMAX` before copying or appending data to the buffer, a buffer overflow can occur. An attacker could provide an excessively long string as an option argument, leading to an out-of-bounds write, which may result in denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
