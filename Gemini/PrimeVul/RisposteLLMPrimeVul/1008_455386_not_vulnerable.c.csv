"1","True","CWE-413","Inconsistent Locking Order","The product uses an inconsistent order when acquiring multiple locks, which can lead to a deadlock.","The code acquires two spinlocks, pag->pag_ici_lock and ip->i_flags_lock, in a nested fashion. If another part of the system attempts to acquire these same two locks in the reverse order, it can lead to a deadlock, causing the system to hang or become unresponsive. This is a classic concurrency vulnerability."
