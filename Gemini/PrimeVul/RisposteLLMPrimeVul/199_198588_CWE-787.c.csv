"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code contains multiple instances of out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities. When iterating through a line of text obtained via ml_get_curline(), several checks involving pointer arithmetic like *(that + 1) or array indexing like that[1] are performed without first ensuring that 'that' is not pointing to the null terminator at the end of the buffer. This can lead to reading past the end of the allocated memory for the line, potentially causing a crash (denial of service) or information disclosure. This issue is present in the logic for skipping comments, escaped characters, and within string literal parsing."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability during string parsing. Specifically, within the `while (*++that && *that != '""')` loop, if an escaped backslash character (`\`) is the last character before the null terminator of the line buffer (e.g., `""...\""`), the `that` pointer can be advanced to point to the null terminator. When the outer `while` loop condition `*++that` is subsequently evaluated, `that` is incremented past the null terminator, resulting in an out-of-bounds read when `*that` is dereferenced. This can lead to a crash or information disclosure."
