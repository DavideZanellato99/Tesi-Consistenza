"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet performs a series of integer range checks. There are no operations that could lead to buffer overflows, integer overflows or underflows, memory leaks, or other common C/C++ vulnerabilities. The function is a pure function that takes two integers and returns a boolean based on direct comparisons, without any side effects or external interactions that could introduce security risks."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a pure function that performs range checks on two integer inputs. It does not involve memory operations, dynamic allocation, sensitive data processing, or complex arithmetic that could lead to common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or race conditions. The comparisons are straightforward and safe."
