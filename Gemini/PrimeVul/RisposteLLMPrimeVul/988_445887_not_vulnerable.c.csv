"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program.","The function fr_window_archive_add_with_filter takes several string parameters (include_files, exclude_files, exclude_folders, dest_dir) which are likely user-controlled. It passes these parameters directly to fr_archive_add_files_with_filter without any explicit validation or sanitization. This lack of input validation can allow an attacker to inject malicious data, potentially leading to path traversal if dest_dir contains sequences like ../, or command injection if the filter strings are used in a shell command without proper escaping, or other vulnerabilities in the underlying archive function."
"2","True","CWE-78","OS Command Injection","The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.","The function passes user-controlled string parameters such as include_files, exclude_files, and exclude_folders directly to fr_archive_add_files_with_filter. If these parameters are used to construct a shell command or a regular expression without proper sanitization or escaping in the called function, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands or craft malicious patterns leading to command injection or denial-of-service."
