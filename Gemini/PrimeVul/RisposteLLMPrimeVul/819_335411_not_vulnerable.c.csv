"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The software uses an externally-controlled format string in a function that performs formatting, which can lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.","The 'arg' variable, derived from user-controlled input 'eap->arg', is passed directly to 'set_option_value_give_err'. If this function or any function it calls uses 'arg' as a format string argument in a 'printf'-style function (e.g., printf(arg);), it creates a format string vulnerability. An attacker could inject format specifiers to read or write arbitrary memory, leading to information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service."
