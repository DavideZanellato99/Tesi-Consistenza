"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be controlled by an actor. This can lead to a denial of service or other undesirable system behavior.","The function uses strdup to copy the input 'path' without any length validation. An attacker can provide an extremely long path string, leading to excessive memory allocation attempts and potential denial of service through resource exhaustion. While the code checks for NULL return from strdup, repeated attempts to allocate large amounts of memory can still exhaust system resources."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet demonstrates robust error handling and memory management. It checks for NULL return values from memory allocation functions (ssh_buffer_new, ssh_string_from_char, malloc, strdup) and handles these failures by returning NULL and setting appropriate error states. Resources like ssh_buffer, ssh_string, sftp_message, sftp_status_message, and sftp_file are consistently freed in all execution paths, preventing memory leaks. The use of strdup for the path argument includes a NULL check for the allocated memory, preventing potential issues if memory allocation fails. There are no apparent buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflows, or unhandled NULL pointer dereferences, assuming standard library function behavior and valid, non-NULL input for the 'path' argument."
