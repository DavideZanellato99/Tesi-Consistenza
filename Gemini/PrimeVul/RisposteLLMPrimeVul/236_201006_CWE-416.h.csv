"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access. The 'index' parameter, an unsigned integer, is used directly to access 'table[index]' without any bounds checking. The 'table' pointer points to a memory region of PAGE_SIZE (typically 4096 bytes) obtained either via kmap_atomic or memremap. If an attacker can control the 'index' value such that 'index * sizeof(pt_element_t)' exceeds PAGE_SIZE, it will result in an out-of-bounds read and write operation during the CMPXCHG call. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel context."
