"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates the available buffer size for UTF-8 decoding incorrectly. The expression (size_t)(p - parser->end) results in a large positive number due to integer underflow when p is less than parser->end. This causes uni_utf8_get_char_n to attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer (parser->end), leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This can result in information leakage, denial of service (crash), or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code calculates the 'max_len' argument for the 'uni_utf8_get_char_n' function incorrectly. It computes '(size_t)(p - parser->end)' instead of the correct remaining buffer length '(size_t)(parser->end - p)'. When 'p' is less than 'parser->end', this calculation results in a negative value. Casting this negative value to 'size_t' (an unsigned type) yields a very large positive number. This misleads 'uni_utf8_get_char_n' into believing that a vast amount of data is available, potentially causing it to read beyond the actual buffer boundary ('parser->end') if an incomplete multi-byte UTF-8 character is encountered at the end of the input, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability."
