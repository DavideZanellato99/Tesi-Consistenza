"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow execution of arbitrary code.","The code iterates MAX_INTERCEPT times, accessing 'intercepts' arrays in 'c', 'h', and 'g'. If MAX_INTERCEPT exceeds the actual allocated size of these arrays within 'struct vmcb_control_area', an out-of-bounds write will occur when assigning to 'c->intercepts[i]'. This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
