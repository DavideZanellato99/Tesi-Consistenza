"1","True","CWE-749","Exposed Dangerous Method or Function","The product exposes a method or function that is dangerous when used in the context of the product's intended operation. This can lead to unintended behavior, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code incorrectly manipulates the Squirrel VM stack and passes an incorrect number of parameters to sq_call. The sq_call function expects the callable object at the top of the stack, followed by its arguments, and the nparams argument should reflect the count of these arguments. However, the code pushes the root table, then the function object and its arguments, and then calls sq_call with a parameter count (nparams) that includes the thread object itself from the calling VM's stack. This mismatch causes sq_call to attempt to execute an object at an incorrect and potentially invalid stack position (likely an underflow), leading to a denial of service (crash) in the Squirrel VM."

"3","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates resources, but it does not limit or throttle the size or amount of resources that are allocated, which can exhaust available resources.","The code does not limit the number of parameters (nparams) that can be passed to the target thread. An attacker can control nparams by pushing an excessive number of arguments onto the current VM's stack before calling thread_call. This can lead to resource exhaustion (e.g., stack overflow in the target thread's VM) and a denial of service."
