"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a value by zero, which can lead to an application crash or other unpredictable behavior. This can result in a denial of service or other impacts depending on the context of the division.","The code evaluates a 'stride' value but does not explicitly check if it is zero before passing it to the 'ctx->Subshape' function. If 'stride' is zero and 'ctx->Subshape' does not handle this case gracefully by returning an error status, it could lead to a division-by-zero error or an infinite loop within 'ctx->Subshape', resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability."

"3","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product attempts to divide a number by zero, which can lead to a crash or an exit of the product.","The code retrieves a 'stride' value from a node attribute, which can be zero. This 'stride' value is then passed to the 'ctx->Subshape' function without an explicit check for zero. If 'ctx->Subshape' performs calculations that involve dividing by 'stride' (e.g., to determine the number of elements in the slice or the step size), a 'stride' of zero will result in a division-by-zero error, leading to a program crash and a denial of service."
