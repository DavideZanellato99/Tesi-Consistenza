"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be allocated or assigned, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code snippet contains multiple instances of NULL pointer dereference. In the EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IV_FIXED, EVP_CTRL_AEAD_GET_TAG, and EVP_CTRL_AEAD_TLS1_AAD cases, the 'ptr' argument, which is a void pointer, is dereferenced (either directly or via memcpy) without a prior check to ensure it is not NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed for 'ptr' in these cases, it will lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service."

"5","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow arbitrary code execution.","The code snippet is vulnerable due to insufficient validation of the 'ptr' argument in several control cases, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically, in the EVP_CTRL_AEAD_GET_TAG case, 'memcpy(ptr, actx->tag, arg);' attempts to copy 'arg' bytes to 'ptr'. If 'ptr' is NULL or points to a buffer smaller than 'arg' bytes, this will result in an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow). Similar issues exist for out-of-bounds reads in EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IV_FIXED, EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_TAG, and EVP_CTRL_AEAD_TLS1_AAD where 'ptr' is read without ensuring it points to a valid, sufficiently sized buffer. The function relies on the caller to provide a valid and adequately sized buffer for 'ptr', but it does not perform checks to enforce this, making it susceptible to misuse that can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution."
