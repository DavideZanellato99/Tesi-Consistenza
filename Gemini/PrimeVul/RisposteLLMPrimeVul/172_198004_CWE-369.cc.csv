"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a variety of problems, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, and denial of service.","The code extracts `max_size_per_class` and `max_total_size_per_batch` from input tensors using `scalar<int>()()`. If the input tensor values for these parameters exceed the maximum value representable by a signed 32-bit integer (INT_MAX), an integer overflow will occur during the conversion. This can lead to these variables holding unexpected smaller positive or negative values. Such incorrect values could then be used in subsequent memory allocation calls or loop bounds within `BatchedNonMaxSuppressionOp`, potentially resulting in buffer overflows, out-of-bounds memory access, or denial-of-service conditions. While there is a warning for large `max_total_size_per_batch` values, it does not prevent the integer overflow itself."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly handle a resultant value that is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type.","The code extracts max_size_per_class and max_total_size_per_batch from input tensors using scalar<int>()(). If the input tensor contains a value larger than INT_MAX, this operation will cause an integer overflow, leading to a wraparound where the variable holds an incorrect, typically much smaller, positive or negative value. For example, a value like 2 * INT_MAX + 1 could wrap around to 1. This incorrect value would then be used in subsequent logic, such as the max_total_size_per_batch > 0 check (which would pass if it wraps to a small positive number) and the BatchedNonMaxSuppressionOp function. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or even denial of service if the small, wrapped-around value is used for memory allocation, potentially causing a buffer overflow when more data than the allocated size is written, or by bypassing the OOM warning for large values."
