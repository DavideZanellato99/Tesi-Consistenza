"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource and cause a denial of service.","The code uses tag->sig.params.size() to determine the size for curr->operands.resize(). If the tag object, which is derived from untrusted input (the Wasm binary), can specify an excessively large number of parameters in its signature without proper validation or capping, an attacker could craft a malicious Wasm binary to cause the application to attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, leading to a denial of service."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly validates the 'index' against the size of 'wasm.tags' before accessing an element, preventing out-of-bounds reads. The 'curr->operands' vector is resized to 'num' before elements are accessed in the loop, ensuring all accesses are within the allocated bounds. No apparent integer overflows or underflows in array indexing are present. Potential resource exhaustion due to a very large 'num' depends on upstream validation of 'tag->sig.params.size()', which is not part of this snippet's direct responsibility."
