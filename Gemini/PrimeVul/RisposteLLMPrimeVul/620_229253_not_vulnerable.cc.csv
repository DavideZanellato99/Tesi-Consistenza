"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C++ code snippet constructs a multimap of strings representing supported features for a CQL server response. All keys and values inserted into the multimap are either static string literals, derived from internal server configuration variables, or formatted from integer values using a safe format string literal (e.g., format(""{:d}"", ...)). There is no direct user input incorporated into the strings without proper sanitization or validation. The use of std::multimap and sstring (likely a robust string type) handles memory allocation dynamically, mitigating buffer overflow risks. The format function is used with literal format specifiers, preventing format string vulnerabilities. Resource management is handled by std::unique_ptr. No obvious vulnerabilities such as injection, buffer overflows, format string bugs, or information leakage are present in this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C++ code snippet constructs a CQL 'SUPPORTED' response by populating a std::multimap with various server capabilities and configuration details. The data inserted into the map originates from hardcoded strings, internal server configuration (_server._config), and results of internal functions (e.g., this_shard_id(), protocol_extension_name()). There is no direct processing of untrusted external input in the construction of the options map. The use of std::string (or sstring), std::multimap, and std::unique_ptr ensures proper memory management, mitigating risks of buffer overflows or memory leaks. String formatting uses a safe mechanism (format(""{:d}"", ...)) which prevents format string vulnerabilities. The information being exposed is intentionally part of the 'SUPPORTED' message and does not constitute an information leak of sensitive data.
