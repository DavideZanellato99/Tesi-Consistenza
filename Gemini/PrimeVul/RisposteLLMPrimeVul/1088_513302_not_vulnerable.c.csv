"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, typically resulting in a crash or termination of the application.","The code does not perform null checks on the input pointer 'tab' or its derived members like 'tab->table' and 'table->file' before dereferencing them. If 'tab' or any of these intermediate pointers are NULL, it will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing the application to crash."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function `join_ft_read_first` dereferences multiple pointers (`tab`, `table`, `table->file`, `table->record`) without prior null checks. If any of these pointers are NULL at runtime, the program will attempt to access invalid memory, leading to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior, resulting in a denial of service. Specifically, `tab->table`, `tab->ref.key`, `table->file`, `table->file->inited`, `table->file->ha_index_init`, `table->file->ft_init`, `table->file->ha_ft_read`, and `table->record[0]` are all dereferenced without validation."
