"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates first_char from common->re->first_codeunit, which is derived from a user-controlled regular expression pattern. If the PCRE2_FIRSTCASELESS flag is set, the code calls TABLE_GET(first_char, common->fcc, first_char). If TABLE_GET is implemented as an unchecked array lookup (e.g., common->fcc[first_char]), and common->fcc is a fixed-size table (e.g., for 8-bit character ranges) while first_char can represent a larger Unicode code point (e.g., in a 16-bit or 32-bit PCRE2 configuration), an attacker could craft a regular expression that causes first_char to exceed the bounds of common->fcc. This would result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service. The subsequent conditional handling for first_char > 127 suggests that TABLE_GET might be used with an index that could exceed its intended bounds for non-ASCII characters."
