"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Inside the while (from < end) loop, the pointer 'from' is advanced by 'step' using 'from += step;'. Immediately after this, the condition 'data != *from' attempts to dereference 'from'. If 'from' was initially pointing to the last valid element in the buffer such that 'from + step' would point one past the end of the buffer (i.e., 'from' becomes equal to 'end'), then '*from' will attempt to read memory outside the bounds of the provided input buffer. This can lead to a crash (denial of service) or potentially information disclosure. The 'from == end' check occurs after the potentially out-of-bounds read in the '||' condition, making it ineffective in preventing the read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a buffer over-read vulnerability. Inside the main while loop, after `from` is incremented by `step`, the condition `if (data != *from || from == end)` dereferences `*from`. If `from` was pointing to `end - step` at the beginning of the iteration, after `from += step;`, `from` will point to `end`. Dereferencing `*from` at this point (`*end`) results in an out-of-bounds read, accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer."
