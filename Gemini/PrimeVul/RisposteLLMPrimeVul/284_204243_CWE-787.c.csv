"1","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software contains a recursive function or method that does not sufficiently limit the depth of the recursion. If an attacker can control the input that leads to the recursive calls, they may be able to cause the program to exhaust its stack space, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially other undefined behavior.","The code snippet contains a recursive call to the `eval1` function within the `case '('` block, which is responsible for parsing nested expressions. If an attacker provides a maliciously crafted input with an excessively deep nesting of parentheses, such as `((((...))))`, it can lead to uncontrolled recursion. This can exhaust the program's stack space, resulting in a stack overflow and a denial of service (DoS) for the application. There are no apparent depth limits or safeguards implemented in this snippet to prevent such an attack."
"2","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software contains a recursive function or method that does not sufficiently limit the depth of the recursion. This can lead to a stack overflow, which may crash the program or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.","The code snippet includes a recursive call to the `eval1` function when parsing nested expressions enclosed in parentheses, as indicated by the `// recursive!` comment. There is no apparent depth limit imposed on this recursion within the provided code. An attacker could craft a deeply nested expression, such as `((((...))))`, which would cause the `eval1` function to call itself excessively, leading to stack exhaustion and a denial of service (DoS) condition for the application."
