"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates an offset for write_extent_buffer by adding offsetof(struct btrfs_dev_stats_item, values), the kernel virtual address of ptr (obtained by casting ptr to unsigned long), and (index * sizeof(u64)). The write_extent_buffer function expects an offset relative to the start of the extent_buffer (eb). However, ((unsigned long)ptr) provides a large kernel virtual address, not a relative offset. This incorrect calculation results in an extremely large offset value, causing write_extent_buffer to attempt to write data far beyond the allocated bounds of the extent_buffer. This constitutes an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution depending on the overwritten memory region."

"3","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates an offset for write_extent_buffer by adding offsetof(struct btrfs_dev_stats_item, values), the casted pointer ((unsigned long)ptr), and (index * sizeof(u64)). The write_extent_buffer function expects its offset argument to be relative to the start of the extent_buffer. However, ptr is a kernel virtual address, not a relative offset. Adding this absolute virtual address directly to other offsets results in a final offset value that is an absolute kernel virtual address. When write_extent_buffer interprets this large absolute address as a relative offset, it will attempt to write far beyond the boundaries of the extent_buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
