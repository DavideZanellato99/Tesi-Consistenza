"1","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The product allocates a resource, but it does not restrict or throttle the allocation of that resource. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) if an attacker can trigger excessive allocations.","The code uses input parameters num_sparse_features and num_dense_features directly to size internal vectors (example->sparse_features_ and example->dense_vectors_) within a loop that iterates num_examples times. While num_examples is checked against int::max(), there are no upper bounds checks on num_sparse_features or num_dense_features themselves. An attacker could provide excessively large values for these integer parameters, leading to attempts to allocate a vast amount of memory (e.g., num_examples * num_sparse_features * sizeof(SparseFeature) bytes). This can exhaust system memory, causing an out-of-memory error and a denial-of-service condition."

"3","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code allocates memory for sparse and dense features based on input parameters num_sparse_features and num_dense_features. While num_examples is capped to prevent excessive allocation, num_sparse_features and num_dense_features lack explicit upper bounds validation within this snippet. An attacker providing extremely large values for these parameters could cause the application to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service."
