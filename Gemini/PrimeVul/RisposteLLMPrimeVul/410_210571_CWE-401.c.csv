"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product allocates memory during program execution, but it does not free the memory after it has finished using it. This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory, eventually causing the program or system to crash or become unstable.","The code has a memory leak. If the call to v4l2_device_register_subdev fails (ret is non-zero), the memory allocated for 'state' using kzalloc is not freed. Only the kfifo buffer is freed, but the main 'state' structure remains allocated, leading to a resource leak."
"2","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a resource after it is no longer needed, which can lead to a gradual consumption of system resources, denial of service, or other issues.","The code contains a memory leak. The 'state' structure is allocated using kzalloc. If kfifo_alloc fails, the function returns -ENOMEM without freeing the 'state' memory. Additionally, if v4l2_device_register_subdev fails, kfifo_free is called for 'state->rx_kfifo', but the 'state' structure itself is not freed, leading to a memory leak in both of these error paths."
