"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The software accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code uses reinterpret_cast to convert node->builtin_data and node->user_data to specific pointer types (TfLiteDivParams* and OpData*). If an attacker can craft a malicious model file or manipulate the runtime state to provide invalid or incorrectly typed data for these fields, dereferencing the resulting pointers (params and data) could lead to type confusion, resulting in crashes, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The snippet lacks explicit validation to ensure the data pointed to by builtin_data and user_data matches the expected types before casting and use."

"3","True","CWE-369","Divide-by-Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to an application crash or other undesirable behavior.","The code implements a division operation but does not include explicit checks to prevent division by zero for the input2 tensor (the divisor). If input2 contains zero values, especially for integer types (kTfLiteInt32 or kTfLiteUInt8), this could lead to undefined behavior, program crashes, or incorrect results (e.g., NaN/Inf for floating-point types) depending on the specific implementation of the delegated EvalDiv or EvalQuantized functions. This lack of a check at the entry point of the division operation constitutes a vulnerability."
