"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates in reverse using 'from' and 'to' parameters of type int64_t. If the 'to' parameter is a negative value, the loop variables ('from' for arrays, 'i' for strings and objects) will eventually become negative. When these negative values are used as indices for array access (e.g., array->start[from]) or as offsets for pointer arithmetic (e.g., string_prop.start + from or p-- in string iteration), it results in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or a crash."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities. An integer overflow occurs if args->from is INT64_MAX, causing from (or i) to wrap around to INT64_MIN after from += 1 or i = from + 1. This negative value is then used as an index for array access (array->start[from]) or passed to a handler, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Furthermore, in the byte/ASCII string iteration, if from is 1 and to is 0, the pointer p is decremented one position too many, causing njs_string_new to read one byte before the string buffer, also resulting in an out-of-bounds read."
