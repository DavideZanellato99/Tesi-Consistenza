"1","True","CWE-562","Return of Stack Variable Address","The software stores the address of a local stack variable in a persistent data structure. This address will become invalid once the function returns and the stack variable is destroyed, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities if the stored address is later dereferenced.","The code creates a Tensor object 'key' on the stack within the 'Compute' function. Its address is then passed to 'map->put()'. If the 'StagingMap' stores this pointer for later use, it will become a dangling pointer once the 'Compute' function returns and the stack-allocated 'key' object is destroyed. Subsequent attempts by the 'StagingMap' to access data through this pointer would result in a use-after-free vulnerability, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior."

"4","True","CWE-416","Use After Free","A Use After Free (UAF) vulnerability occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. This can lead to various issues including crashes, corruption of valid data, or the execution of arbitrary code if an attacker can control the contents of the freed memory region.","The code creates a local Tensor object named 'key' on the stack by copying 'key_tensor'. It then passes the address of this local stack-allocated 'key' object (&key) to the 'map->put' method. If the 'StagingMap' stores this pointer internally without making its own copy of the Tensor data, the pointer will become dangling once the 'Compute' function returns and the local 'key' object is destroyed. Subsequent attempts by the 'StagingMap' to access the data through this dangling pointer will result in undefined behavior, which can lead to crashes, data corruption, or potentially exploitable conditions like information disclosure or arbitrary code execution."
