"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource, which can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or crashes.","The code performs an unchecked C-style cast from GF_Box *s to GF_HintMediaHeaderBox *ptr. If the input pointer s does not actually point to a GF_HintMediaHeaderBox object or a compatible type, or if it is a NULL pointer, the subsequent dereference ptr->size will result in undefined behavior. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, out-of-bounds read/write, or type confusion, potentially causing a crash or memory corruption."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously observed to be NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code does not check if the input pointer 's' is NULL before dereferencing it. If 's' is NULL, the cast '(GF_HintMediaHeaderBox *)s' will result in 'ptr' being NULL. Subsequently, the operation 'ptr->size += 16;' will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a program crash (e.g., segmentation fault) and a denial of service."
