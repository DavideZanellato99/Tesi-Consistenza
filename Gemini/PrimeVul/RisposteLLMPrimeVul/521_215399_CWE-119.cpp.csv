"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code reads a catalog entry into a temporary structure 'tmp' from an external source. It then uses the 'tmp.thread.nodeName' field to build a search key in 'fd->search_key' via the 'hfsplus_cat_build_key_uni' function. If 'tmp.thread.nodeName' contains an excessively long string, potentially from a malicious HFS+ image, and 'hfsplus_cat_build_key_uni' does not perform proper bounds checking before copying this string into the fixed-size buffer 'fd->search_key', a buffer overflow will occur. This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, leading to a buffer overflow.","The code reads a catalog entry from an external source into the `tmp` variable.
