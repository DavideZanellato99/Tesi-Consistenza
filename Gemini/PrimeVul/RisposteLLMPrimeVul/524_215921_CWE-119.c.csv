"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code accesses the 'd1' array (derived from 'kwset->delta') using 'U(tp[-1])' as an index. The definition of the 'U' macro is not provided in the snippet. If 'U' does not cast the character value 'tp[-1]' to an 'unsigned char' (or an equivalent type that guarantees a non-negative index in the range 0-255), and if the 'char' type is signed on the target system, then 'tp[-1]' could evaluate to a negative value. Indexing an array with a negative value results in an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. This is a common vulnerability pattern when character values are used as array indices without proper type conversion."
"2","True","CWE-835","Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')","The product contains a loop that does not terminate or does not terminate in a timely manner, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code contains a potential infinite loop in the second while loop. If the delta value 'd' obtained from 'd1[U((tp += d)[-1])]' becomes zero, and the 'bm_delta2_search' function does not find a match, the loop will continue indefinitely without advancing the 'tp' pointer, leading to a denial of service."
