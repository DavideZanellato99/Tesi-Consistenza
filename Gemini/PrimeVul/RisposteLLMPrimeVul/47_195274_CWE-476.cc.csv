"1","True","CWE-662","Improper Synchronization","The product does not properly synchronize operations or activities, which can lead to a race condition or other unexpected results.","The code renames the 'conv_node' object to the original name of the 'mul_node' and the 'mul_node' object to a new name. However, the 'node_map_' which maps node names to node objects is not updated to reflect the name change of the 'conv_node'. Consequently, subsequent calls to 'node_map_->UpdateInput' and 'MaybeRemoveControlInput' using 'conv_node->name()' will operate on the wrong node (the original 'mul_node' object as identified by its original name in the map), leading to graph corruption, incorrect transformations, and potential runtime errors or crashes."

"5","True","CWE-682","Incorrect Calculation","The product performs a calculation that results in an incorrect value, which can lead to a variety of consequences, including incorrect control flow, denial of service, or data corruption.","The code renames graph nodes by calling set_name on NodeDef objects but fails to update the node_map_ which uses node names as keys. This leads to an inconsistent state where node_map_ references nodes by their old names while the nodes themselves have new names. Consequently, subsequent operations like node_map_->UpdateInput use the incorrect node reference, causing the graph transformation to apply changes to the wrong nodes and resulting in a corrupted graph structure and incorrect computations."
