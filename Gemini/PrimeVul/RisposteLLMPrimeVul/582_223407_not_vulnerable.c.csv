"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The do_extuni_utf function uses the GETCHARINC macro to read Unicode characters from the subject string. The GETCHARINC macro, as commonly defined in PCRE2, does not perform boundary checks for multi-byte characters. The loop condition 'while (cc < end_subject)' only ensures that the starting byte of the character pointed to by 'cc' is within the valid range. If the 'end_subject' pointer falls in the middle of a multi-byte character, or if the last character in the buffer is incomplete, GETCHARINC will attempt to read bytes past the 'end_subject' boundary, leading to a buffer over-read. This can result in a denial of service (crash) or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The `do_extuni_utf` function contains two distinct out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities. In the main `do-while` loop, the `GETCHARINC(c, cc)` macro can read past `end_subject` if a multi-byte UTF-8 character starts near the end of the buffer and extends beyond it, as the loop condition `while (cc < end_subject)` is checked only after the macro completes. Additionally, within the nested `while (bptr > start_subject)` loop, the `BACKCHAR(bptr)` macro can read before `start_subject`. This occurs because `bptr` can become equal to `start_subject` after `bptr--` but before `BACKCHAR(bptr)` is called, leading to an attempt to dereference `*(bptr - 1)`. Both issues are out-of-bounds reads that can be exploited with crafted input to cause information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
