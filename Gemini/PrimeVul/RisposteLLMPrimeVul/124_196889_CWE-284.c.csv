"1","True","CWE-835","Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')","The program contains a loop that does not terminate, or does not terminate under certain conditions, because the exit condition is unreachable or incorrectly specified. This can lead to a denial of service.","The code iterates through PGP packets, advancing a pointer 'p' by the length of each decoded packet. If the 'decodePkt' function can be manipulated by a malicious or malformed input to report a packet length of zero while still returning a success status, the pointer 'p' will not advance. This will cause the 'while (p < pend)' loop to execute indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop and a Denial of Service."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been deallocated, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code initializes `digp` to NULL and attempts to allocate memory for it using `pgpDigParamsNew(pkt.tag)`. Immediately after this, it calls `pgpPrtPkt(&pkt, digp)` without checking if `digp` is still NULL. If `pgpDigParamsNew` fails to allocate memory (e.g., due to an out-of-memory condition) and returns NULL, `digp` will be a NULL pointer. Passing this NULL pointer to `pgpPrtPkt` can lead to a NULL pointer dereference within that function if it attempts to use `digp` without a prior NULL check, resulting in a program crash (denial of service)."
