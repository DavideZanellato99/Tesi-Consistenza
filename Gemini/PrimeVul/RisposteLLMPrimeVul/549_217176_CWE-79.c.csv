"1","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software receives input from an untrusted source but does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes dangerous characters in the input before it is written to a web page.","The code reads content from a log file and directly appends it to the HTTP response within a <textarea> tag. An attacker could inject </textarea> followed by malicious HTML or JavaScript into the log file. When this content is rendered by a browser, the injected </textarea> would prematurely close the legitimate textarea, allowing the subsequent malicious script to be executed in the user's browser context, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."

"5","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software receives input from an untrusted source but does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can be interpreted as executable code or commands when they are later sent to a web browser as part of HTML or JavaScript. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary client-side script into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.","The code reads content directly from a log file and appends it to an HTML output buffer using StringBuffer_append without performing any HTML encoding. If an attacker can inject malicious scripts or HTML tags into the log file (e.g., through other application inputs that are logged), these will be rendered by the user's browser when viewing the log, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
