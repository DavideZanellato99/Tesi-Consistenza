"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The _q_strcpy function correctly implements a bounds-checked string copy. It validates input pointers and size, calculates the appropriate number of bytes to copy to prevent exceeding the destination buffer's capacity, and always null-terminates the destination string. This prevents buffer overflows and ensures string safety."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The _q_strcpy function correctly implements bounds checking by limiting the number of bytes copied to size - 1 and ensuring null termination at dst[copylen]. It also handles null or zero-sized inputs gracefully, preventing buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences."
