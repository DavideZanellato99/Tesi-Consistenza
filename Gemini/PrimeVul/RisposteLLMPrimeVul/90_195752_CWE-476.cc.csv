"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code calculates dense_shape->NumElements(), which represents the total number of elements in the dense tensor. This value can be extremely large if the input dense_shape tensor contains large dimensions. The subsequent line gtl::InlinedVector<int64, 8> std_order(dense_shape->NumElements(), 0); attempts to allocate a vector of int64 elements with a size equal to dense_shape->NumElements(). If an attacker provides a dense_shape with sufficiently large dimensions, dense_shape->NumElements() will be a very large positive number. This will cause an attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory (e.g., multiple exabytes), leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error and a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application. This is an instance of uncontrolled resource consumption."
