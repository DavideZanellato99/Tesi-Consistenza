"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The program writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code modifies the input pattern string 'pat' in place using assignments like '*pe = '\0';' and 't[-1] = '\0';'. If 'pat' is a string literal or points to read-only memory, these write operations will cause a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service. This is a classic out-of-bounds write vulnerability where the program attempts to write to memory it does not have permission to modify."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code modifies the input 'pat' string in place by writing null terminators at various points (*pe = '\0' and t[-1] = '\0'). If 'pat' points to a string literal or other read-only memory, this will cause a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service. The function does not ensure 'pat' is a mutable buffer before attempting to modify it."
