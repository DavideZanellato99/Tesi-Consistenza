"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit in some cases.","The code dereferences pointers such as `task->pid`, `task->pid->filter`, and `task->pid->filter->freg` multiple times without explicit null checks. If any of these pointers are null at the time of dereference, it will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash, denial of service, or potentially other undefined behavior."
