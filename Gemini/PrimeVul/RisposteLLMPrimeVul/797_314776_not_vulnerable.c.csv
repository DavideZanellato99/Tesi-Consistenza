"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The `cdf_read_sector` function reads `len` bytes into the memory location `((char *)buf) + offs`. It lacks proper bounds checking to ensure that the destination buffer `buf` is sufficiently large to hold `offs + len` bytes. If an attacker provides an undersized `buf` or a large `offs` value, an out-of-bounds write will occur when `cdf_read` attempts to write `len` bytes, leading to a buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can often overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to crashes, corruption of data, or execution of arbitrary code.","The function cdf_read_sector calculates a destination address for reading data as ((char *)buf) + offs and then attempts to read len bytes into this location using cdf_read. The function does not perform any bounds checking to ensure that the sum of offs and len does not exceed the actual allocated size of the buf buffer. If an attacker can control or influence the values of offs or len (e.g., by providing a specially crafted file header), they could provide values that cause the cdf_read operation to write data beyond the intended boundaries of buf. This out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
