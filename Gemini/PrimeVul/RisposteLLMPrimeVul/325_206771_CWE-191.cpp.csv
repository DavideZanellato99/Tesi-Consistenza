"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to an incorrect, typically smaller, result. This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues if the result is used for memory allocation or indexing.","The multiplication `4*maxVertices` can result in an integer overflow if `maxVertices` is sufficiently large. If this overflow occurs, the `new double[]` allocation will be for a smaller buffer than intended. Subsequently, the initialization loop and later processing logic will use the original, larger `maxVertices` value for indexing, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when writing data beyond the undersized allocated memory region."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.","The code calculates the size for a dynamic array using `4 * maxVertices`. If `maxVertices` (derived from `groupValue`) is a sufficiently large integer, the multiplication `4 * maxVertices` can result in an integer overflow. This overflow causes `new double[...]` to allocate a smaller memory block than intended. Subsequent writes to `vertices` using indices derived from `vertexIndex` and `groupCode` can then lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to corrupt heap data or achieve arbitrary code execution."
