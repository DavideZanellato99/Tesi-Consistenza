"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two numbers is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the data type intended to hold the result, leading to an incorrect, typically smaller, value. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect memory allocations, or other security vulnerabilities.","The code calculates a new size by adding the product of ptr->trackIDCount and sizeof(u32) to ptr->size. If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the type of ptr->size, an integer overflow will occur. This can result in ptr->size holding an unexpectedly small value, which could later lead to heap buffer overflows or other memory corruption if this size is used for memory allocation or boundary checks."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication or the result of an integer addition or subtraction is larger or smaller than the maximum or minimum value that can be stored in the associated integer type, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other weaknesses.","The code performs an arithmetic operation ptr->trackIDCount * sizeof(u32) which is then added to ptr->size. If ptr->trackIDCount is a large value, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow. An integer overflow would cause ptr->size to be updated with an incorrect, potentially smaller, value.
