"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a shape inference function that uses framework-specific methods to determine and set output shapes. It does not perform any direct memory operations, input parsing, or complex logic that would introduce common security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free. The safety of the underlying framework methods (e.g., c->Dim, c->UnknownDim, c->Matrix, c->Vector) is assumed. No immediate vulnerability is detectable within this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a shape inference function that uses an InferenceContext to determine output shapes based on input dimensions. It retrieves a rank and an unknown dimension value, then sets the shapes for three outputs using these values. There are no direct memory allocations, deallocations, pointer manipulations, array accesses, or input parsing operations within this snippet that could lead to common C/C++ vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, integer overflows, or format string bugs. The operations are high-level shape manipulations within a framework context, and the snippet itself does not introduce security flaws."
