"1","True","CWE-440","Expected Behavior Violation","The product does not behave as expected by the user or by other components, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. This can include violations of documented behavior, implicit assumptions, or common conventions.","The function's documentation states that when a mode is explicitly provided, the directory permissions are set to the exact decimal value specified. However, the underlying mkdir system call always applies the process's umask to the provided mode. This means the actual permissions of the created directory may be more restrictive than specified by the user, contradicting the documentation and violating the expected behavior, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security misconfigurations where specific permissions are required."
"2","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '..' sequences or absolute pathnames that can resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code uses a user-supplied path argument directly in the mkdir system call without apparent sanitization or validation. An attacker could provide a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../) to create directories outside the intended base directory, potentially leading to unauthorized file system modifications or denial of service."
