"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code reads multiple fields from a data buffer 'f' at various offsets relative to 'pos'. There are no explicit bounds checks performed within this function to ensure that 'pos' plus the maximum offset (32 bytes) does not exceed the actual size of the buffer 'f'. If the underlying 'dbuf_getu16be', 'dbuf_getu32be', and 'pict_read_fixed' functions do not internally perform robust bounds checking and error handling, an attacker providing a crafted input buffer or an invalid 'pos' value could trigger an out-of-bounds read. This could lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive data from adjacent memory), denial of service (crashing the application by accessing invalid memory), or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides two numbers, but the divisor is controlled by an external input and can be zero, leading to a divide-by-zero error.","The code calculates bi->pdwidth using the expression (bi->rowbytes*8)/bi->pixelsize. The value of bi->pixelsize is read directly from the input buffer using dbuf_getu16be(f, pos+18). If a malicious or malformed input provides a value of 0 for bi->pixelsize, a division-by-zero error will occur, leading to a program crash and a denial of service."
