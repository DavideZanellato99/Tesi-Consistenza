"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than the maximum size that can be stored in the available memory space. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The function calculates a size using an integer multiplication and addition. The result of this calculation, which can exceed the maximum value for an int, is then assigned to an int variable computed_size. If the intermediate calculation overflows the int type, computed_size will hold an incorrect, potentially smaller or negative, value. This integer overflow can lead to subsequent memory allocation errors, such as heap buffer overflows, if the incorrect size is used to allocate a buffer."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication or the result of an integer addition/subtraction is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the destination integer type, or smaller than the minimum value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The function calculates a size based on an input 'size' parameter. The multiplication 'sizeof(dummy.data[0]) * size' can result in an integer overflow if 'size' is sufficiently large. This overflow can cause 'computed_size' to wrap around to a small or negative value. If this value is subsequently used for memory allocation or buffer sizing, it could lead to a heap overflow, buffer overflow, or denial of service."
