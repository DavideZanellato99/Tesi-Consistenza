"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically causes a program to crash or to behave in an unpredictable way.","The code retrieves a pointer to an RArray structure using mrb_ary_ptr(ary) but does not check if the returned pointer 'a' is NULL before dereferencing it with ARY_LEN(a). If mrb_ary_ptr(ary) returns NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a program crash or undefined behavior."
