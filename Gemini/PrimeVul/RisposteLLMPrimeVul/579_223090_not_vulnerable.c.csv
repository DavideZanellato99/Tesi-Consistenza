"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The program writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The PCLPackbitsCompressImage function writes compressed data to the compress_pixels buffer without performing any bounds checking on its size. If the compress_pixels buffer provided by the caller is too small to accommodate the compressed output, the function will write past the end of the allocated memory, leading to an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow). This can result in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) in two places. Firstly, the compress_pixels output buffer is written to without any size checks. The q pointer is incremented as compressed data is written, and there is no mechanism to prevent it from writing beyond the allocated memory for compress_pixels, leading to a buffer overflow. Secondly, within the literal run compression logic, the local packbits array (declared as unsigned char packbits[128]) is subject to an out-of-bounds write. The loop condition count >= 127 allows count to reach 127, and then packbits[count+1] (i.e., packbits[128]) is written to, which is one byte past the end of the allocated array, corrupting stack memory. Both issues can lead to data corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
