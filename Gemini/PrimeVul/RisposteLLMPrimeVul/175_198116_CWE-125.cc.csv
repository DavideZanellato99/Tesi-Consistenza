"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two numbers is calculated, and the result is larger than the maximum size for the data type that is used to store it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, incorrect calculations, or other problems.","The `CoordinatesToFlatIndex` lambda calculates a flat index `idx` by summing products of `coords[i]` and `strides[i]`. Both `coords` and `strides` elements are `int64_t`. If the product `coords[i] * strides[i]` or the cumulative sum `idx` exceeds the maximum value for `int64_t`, an integer overflow will occur. This overflow will cause `idx` to wrap around, resulting in an incorrect, potentially out-of-bounds index. This incorrect index is then used to access `out_flat(idx)`, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory, causing a crash, or enabling arbitrary code execution. An attacker controlling the input `shape_t` and `reduction_axes_t` could potentially craft values that trigger this overflow."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication or the result of an integer addition is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to an incorrect, truncated value that can then be used in security-critical operations like array indexing or memory allocation.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow. The calculation of output_strides and the flat index idx in CoordinatesToFlatIndex involves multiplications and additions of int64 values. If input dimensions or coordinates are sufficiently large, these operations can overflow int64. An integer overflow would cause idx to wrap around, potentially resulting in a small positive or negative value. This out-of-bounds index is then used to write to out_flat(idx), leading to an out-of-bounds write, which can corrupt memory or lead to denial of service."
