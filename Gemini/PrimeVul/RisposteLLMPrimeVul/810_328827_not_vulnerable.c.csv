"1","True","CWE-126","Buffer Over-read","The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can lead to a crash, information disclosure, or other unexpected behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer over-read (CWE-126) in the R_BIN_JAVA_EV_TAG_ANNOTATION case. The loop condition `if (offset > sz)` is insufficient; it should be `if (offset >= sz)`. If `offset` equals `sz`, the loop continues, and `r_bin_java_element_pair_new` is called with an out-of-bounds pointer (`buffer + sz`) and a size of `0`. This results in undefined behavior, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure if the function attempts to dereference the invalid pointer. Furthermore, in both the R_BIN_JAVA_EV_TAG_ARRAY and R_BIN_JAVA_EV_TAG_ANNOTATION cases, the `num_values` and `num_element_value_pairs` fields are read directly from the input buffer without any upper bound validation. An attacker can provide excessively large values for these fields, leading to an uncontrolled number of recursive calls and memory allocations, which can result in a denial of service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (CWE-400)."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains an off-by-one error in the R_BIN_JAVA_EV_TAG_ANNOTATION case. Inside the loop that processes element_value_pairs, the boundary check `if (offset > sz)` should be `if (offset >= sz)`. If `offset` is exactly equal to `sz`, the condition `offset > sz` is false, causing the loop to continue. Subsequently, `r_bin_java_element_pair_new` is called with `buffer + offset` (which is `buffer + sz`) and `sz - offset` (which is 0). Passing `buffer + sz` as a pointer to the `r_bin_java_element_pair_new` function results in an out-of-bounds pointer, leading to undefined behavior, which can cause crashes, memory corruption, or information disclosure."
