"1","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index","The software uses an array index that can be controlled by an untrusted input, but the software does not properly validate the index, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write.","The function gif_interlaced_line calculates a line index based on height and y. It does not validate the input y. If y is negative, performing a left shift operation (y << N) on a negative signed integer results in undefined behavior according to the C/C++ standard, which can lead to unpredictable program execution or crashes. Furthermore, if y is greater than or equal to height, the function can return a calculated line number that is outside the valid range of 0 to height-1. If this return value is subsequently used as an array index without further validation, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, potentially causing denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product, sum, or difference of two or more numbers is greater than the maximum (or less than the minimum) value allowed for the data type and the result is truncated, or the value wraps around to a different sign.","The code is vulnerable to integer overflow. If the 'height' parameter is sufficiently large (e.g., close to INT_MAX), expressions like 'height + 7' will overflow. This overflow results in an incorrect intermediate value. If the overflowed value becomes negative, the subsequent right shift operation on a negative signed integer results in implementation-defined behavior, leading to incorrect line calculations and potential out-of-bounds access or other logical errors."
