"1","True","CWE-502","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other attacks if the application deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation.","The code snippet deserializes WDDX data, and when an element is identified as a PHP object, it automatically calls the `__wakeup()` magic method on that object. This constitutes an insecure deserialization vulnerability (PHP Object Injection) because an attacker can craft malicious WDDX input to instantiate objects of arbitrary classes and trigger their `__wakeup()` methods, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other impacts depending on the available classes and their methods in the application."

"3","True","CWE-502","Deserialization of Untrusted Data","The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid or harmless. This can lead to various attacks, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and authentication bypass, depending on the nature of the deserialized data and the context in which it is used.","The code deserializes WDDX data, which can contain serialized PHP objects. During deserialization, the __wakeup() magic method is invoked on objects, and object properties can be set using attacker-controlled data. This allows an attacker to craft malicious WDDX payloads to trigger arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions by exploiting vulnerable __wakeup() methods or other methods in the application's codebase, leading to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability."
