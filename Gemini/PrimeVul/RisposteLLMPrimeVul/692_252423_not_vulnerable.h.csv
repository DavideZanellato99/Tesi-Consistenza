"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code retrieves an offset from pZip->m_pState->m_central_dir_offsets using file_index. While file_index is checked against pZip->m_total_files, the retrieved offset value itself is then used to access pZip->m_pState->m_central_dir without any bounds validation against the size of m_central_dir. An attacker could craft a malicious zip file containing an out-of-bounds offset in m_central_dir_offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read when m_central_dir is accessed."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code retrieves an offset from pZip->m_pState->m_central_dir_offsets using a bounds-checked file_index.
