"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.","The calculation of maxCachedGlyphSizeSquared involves squaring a value that can be controlled via the QT_MAX_CACHED_GLYPH_SIZE environment variable. If this environment variable is set to a sufficiently large integer, the result of std::pow(..., 2) will exceed the maximum value representable by an int when cast, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow would cause maxCachedGlyphSizeSquared to hold an incorrect, potentially much smaller or negative, value, which then affects the subsequent comparison and the application's glyph caching logic, potentially leading to denial of service or unexpected performance."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap around to become a small or negative number, rather than the expected large positive number. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The code reads an integer from the environment variable ""QT_MAX_CACHED_GLYPH_SIZE"", squares it using std::pow, and stores the result in an int. If an attacker sets the environment variable to a large value, the squared result can exceed the maximum value for an int. The subsequent implicit conversion from double (returned by std::pow) to int results in undefined behavior, potentially causing maxCachedGlyphSizeSquared to become a small or negative value. This could lead to the glyph caching mechanism being effectively disabled, resulting in a denial of service due to excessive rendering computations."
