"1","True","CWE-762","Mismatched Memory Management Routines","The program uses memory management routines that are not compatible with each other, which can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other undefined behavior.","The GHashTable is initialized with g_free as the key destroy function. This creates a vulnerability if keys inserted into the hash table are not dynamically allocated strings that can be safely freed by g_free. Inserting stack-allocated strings, string literals, or memory allocated by incompatible routines will lead to a double-free, use-after-free, or memory corruption when the hash table is destroyed or keys are removed, resulting in undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-763","Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference","The program attempts to release a pointer or reference that is invalid, such as one that has already been released, one that was never allocated, or one that points to a static or stack variable.","The code initializes a GHashTable with g_free as the key destruction function. This means that when keys are removed from the hash table or the hash table is destroyed, g_free will be called on each key. If keys inserted into client->priv->app_proxies are not dynamically allocated (e.g., they are string literals or pointers to stack-allocated memory), calling g_free on them will result in undefined behavior, leading to memory corruption or a program crash. This creates a potential for a release of an invalid pointer or a double-free vulnerability if the keys are managed incorrectly by the caller."
