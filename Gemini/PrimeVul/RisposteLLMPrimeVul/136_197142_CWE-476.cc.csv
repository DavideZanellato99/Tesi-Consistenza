"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds access due to insufficient validation of input tensor dimensions. In the case where num_slices is 1, if input_min_range or input_max_range are empty tensors, accessing index 0 via flat<float>()(0) will result in an out-of-bounds read. When num_slices is greater than 1, num_slices is derived from input.dim_size(axis_). The code then iterates from 0 to num_slices - 1, accessing elements of min_ranges and max_ranges (derived from input_min_range and input_max_range) and writing to output_min_tensor and output_max_tensor. If input_min_range or input_max_range have fewer elements than num_slices, these accesses will result in out-of-bounds reads and writes, leading to potential crashes, data corruption, or other undefined behavior."
