"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided C++ code snippet is a constant getter method that returns a constant reference to a std::vector<std::string>. This is a standard and safe practice for providing read-only access to an internal data member. The use of 'const' on both the return type and the method itself prevents modification of the vector's contents or the object's state through this getter, and it does not introduce any direct memory safety, information disclosure, or other common vulnerabilities in isolation."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet is a standard C++ getter method that returns a constant reference to a private member variable. This pattern provides read-only access to internal state without exposing direct modification capabilities or creating copies, which is generally considered safe and good practice. It does not introduce memory safety issues, information disclosure beyond what is intended by the method's purpose, or other common vulnerabilities. Any potential issues would stem from the broader context of how the `expected_local_uri_` member is populated or how the returned reference is used, rather than from this specific getter implementation itself."
