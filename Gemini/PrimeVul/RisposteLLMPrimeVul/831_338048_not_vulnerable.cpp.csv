"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet performs a bounds check (index >= functionTypes.size()) before accessing the functionTypes array/vector at the given index. If the index is out of bounds, an error is thrown, preventing an out-of-bounds read. This effectively mitigates array indexing vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs a bounds check `index >= functionTypes.size()`. However, if the type `Index` is a signed integer, a negative value for `index` would bypass this check because a negative number is always less than the unsigned or positive `functionTypes.size()`. This would lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `functionTypes[index]` with a negative index, resulting in undefined behavior, potential information disclosure, or a crash."
