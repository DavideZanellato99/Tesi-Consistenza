"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, or that has been intentionally set to NULL. This typically causes the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.","The function cmpfcncc does not validate if the input pointers _a or _b are NULL before casting them to RAnalFunction* and passing them to r_anal_function_complexity. If _a or _b are NULL, a dereference of a NULL pointer will occur within r_anal_function_complexity (assuming it does not handle NULL inputs), leading to a crash or denial of service."
