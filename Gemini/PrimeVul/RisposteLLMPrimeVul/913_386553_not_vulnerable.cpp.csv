"1","True","CWE-116","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output","The product receives input from an untrusted source, and that input contains special elements that are not neutralized when the input is written to an output. This can lead to the special elements being interpreted as active content, control codes, or other forms of data that can modify the intended structure or behavior of the output.","The 'name' parameter, which is user-controlled input, is directly written to the DXF file via dw.dxfString(2, name). If the 'name' string contains characters that have special meaning within the DXF file format (e.g., newline characters or specific delimiters), and the dxfString function does not properly escape or neutralize these characters, it can lead to a malformed DXF file. This could cause DXF parsers to misinterpret the file structure, leading to errors, crashes, or potentially other vulnerabilities in the parsing software. The code does not perform any sanitization or escaping of the 'name' string before passing it to dxfString."

"5","True","CWE-74","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')","The software constructs a string or other data structure using input from an untrusted source, but it does not properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control characters or commands by a downstream component. This can lead to various types of injection attacks, depending on the context in which the output is used.","The code directly uses the user-provided 'name' string in the 'dw.dxfString' function without explicit sanitization or escaping within this snippet. If the 'dxfString' function does not properly neutralize special characters or sequences relevant to the DXF file format, an attacker could inject malformed data, leading to file corruption or unexpected parser behavior when the DXF file is processed."
