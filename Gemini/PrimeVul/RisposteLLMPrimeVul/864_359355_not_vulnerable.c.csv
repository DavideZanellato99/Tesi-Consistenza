"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code passes an unvalidated user-supplied string from argv[1] (assigned to name) to the bgp_get function. If bgp_get copies this string into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, it could lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code or corrupt memory."

"4","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, format string bugs, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.","The code snippet takes `argv[1]` as a `name` argument without performing any validation on its length or content. This user-controlled string is then passed to the `bgp_get` function. If `bgp_get` uses this `name` in an operation involving a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, an attacker could provide an overly long string for `name`, leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for the `name` argument."
