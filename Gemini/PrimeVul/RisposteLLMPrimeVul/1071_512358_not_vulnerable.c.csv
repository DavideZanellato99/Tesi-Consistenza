"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet returns a const pointer to a member variable or NULL based on a condition. Returning NULL to indicate the absence of a valid result is a standard and safe practice in C++. The responsibility to check for a NULL return value before dereferencing the pointer lies with the calling code, not with this function itself. This snippet does not introduce any direct memory safety issues, information leaks, or other vulnerabilities."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly returns a const pointer to a double member or NULL. The function itself does not introduce any vulnerabilities; it follows standard C++ practices for returning an optional pointer to an existing object member. Potential issues like null pointer dereference would arise from improper handling of the NULL return value by the caller, not from this function's implementation."
