"1","True","CWE-908","Use of Uninitialized Resource","The software uses a resource that has not been initialized. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, information leaks, or crashes. In the context of memory, using uninitialized memory can expose sensitive data from previous allocations or lead to arbitrary code execution if the uninitialized data is interpreted as pointers or code.","The seq_buf_alloc function uses kvmalloc to allocate kernel memory. kvmalloc does not guarantee that the allocated memory is zero-initialized. If the memory returned by this function is subsequently used without being fully overwritten, it may contain sensitive data from previous kernel memory allocations, potentially leading to an information leak to an unauthorized actor. The caller of this function must ensure proper initialization of the allocated buffer before its contents are used or exposed."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple wrapper function that calls kvmalloc and returns its result. It does not perform any operations that introduce vulnerabilities such as integer overflows, out-of-bounds accesses, or use-after-free issues within its scope. The function correctly passes the size parameter to kvmalloc and returns the allocated pointer. Potential vulnerabilities, such as NULL pointer dereferences if kvmalloc fails and returns NULL, or memory exhaustion, would arise from how the caller of seq_buf_alloc handles the returned pointer (e.g., by not checking for a NULL return value before dereferencing) or how the size parameter is derived, rather than from a flaw within this specific snippet itself."
