"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Underflow","An integer underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is less than the minimum value representable by a given type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows or incorrect calculations, if the resulting wrapped-around value is used in subsequent operations like memory allocation or array indexing.","The ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE macro likely performs an unchecked subtraction on a size counter. If the remaining size is less than 4 bytes, this could lead to an integer underflow, causing the size counter to wrap around to a very large value. This incorrect size could then be used in subsequent operations, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads or other memory corruption issues."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location outside of the bounds of the buffer.","The code reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from a bitstream using gf_bs_read_u32. If the underlying bitstream buffer does not contain at least 4 bytes of data remaining and the gf_bs_read_u32 function does not perform adequate bounds checking, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially disclosing sensitive information or causing a denial of service due to a crash. The ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE macro's behavior is unknown but its name suggests size tracking rather than a definitive bounds check before the read."
