"1","True","CWE-208","Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy","The product exposes sensitive information to an attacker by allowing the attacker to measure the time it takes to perform certain operations.","The function performs modular multiplication, a cryptographic operation. If the underlying variable-length integer (VLI) multiplication (uECC_vli_mult) or modular reduction (uECC_vli_mmod) functions are not implemented in a constant-time manner, an attacker could potentially deduce secret information by observing the execution time of this function, leading to a side-channel vulnerability."
"2","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The software copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without sufficiently checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The 'product' array is allocated on the stack with a fixed size of '2 * uECC_MAX_WORDS'. The 'uECC_vli_mult' function writes into this buffer based on the 'num_words' parameter. If 'num_words' can be greater than 'uECC_MAX_WORDS', the 'uECC_vli_mult' function will attempt to write beyond the allocated bounds of the 'product' array, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. The code snippet does not include any bounds checking for 'num_words' against 'uECC_MAX_WORDS'."
