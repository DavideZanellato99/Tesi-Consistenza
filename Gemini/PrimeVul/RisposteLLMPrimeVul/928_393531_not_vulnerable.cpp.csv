"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The software accesses a resource with a type that is incompatible with the resource's original type, which can lead to out-of-bounds access, incorrect operations, or other undefined behavior.","The code implicitly assumes that the SQObject retrieved from the stack at index 1 is an array before casting it to SQArray* using _array(o). If an attacker can provide a non-array object at this stack position, the subsequent dereferencing of the 'a' pointer (e.g., a->Size() or a->Get()) would operate on an incorrectly typed or invalid memory region, leading to a type confusion vulnerability. This could result in a crash (denial of service) or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution or information disclosure if the attacker can control the memory layout."

"4","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The software accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type, which can lead to out-of-bounds access, incorrect calculations, or other undefined behavior.","The code implicitly assumes that the object retrieved from the stack at index 1 is always an SQArray. The `_array(o)` operation likely performs a direct cast without proper type validation. If a non-array object is provided by an attacker, this type confusion can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution when methods like `Size()` or `Get()` are called on the incorrectly cast pointer."
