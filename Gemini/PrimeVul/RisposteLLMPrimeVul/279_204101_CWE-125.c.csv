"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or information disclosure.","The code attempts to read the constant value index using an offset relative to the start of the entire buffer (`buffer`) instead of relative to the start of the current attribute (`buffer + buf_offset`). Specifically, `R_BIN_JAVA_USHORT (buffer, offset)` should be `R_BIN_JAVA_USHORT (buffer, buf_offset + offset)`. This results in reading incorrect data from an unintended memory location, which can lead to logical errors or, if the calculated address falls outside the allocated buffer, an out-of-bounds read."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code reads a 2-byte unsigned short from buffer at offset without verifying that offset + 2 is within the bounds of the provided sz. If sz is less than offset + 2 (i.e., less than 8, given offset starts at 6), an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing buffer[offset+1], potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure."
