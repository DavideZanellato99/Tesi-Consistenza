"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software performs a write operation to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.","The code attempts to assign a value to pols[1] within the CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY block. The pols array is passed as a pointer to pointers, and its allocated size is implicitly determined by the caller, typically based on the initial value of *num_pols. If *num_pols is initially 1, and the condition pols[0]->action == XFRM_POLICY_ALLOW && pols[0]->type != XFRM_POLICY_TYPE_MAIN is true, then pols[1] will be written to, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The subsequent increment of (*num_pols) and the loop iterating up to *num_pols would then cause an out-of-bounds read when pols[1] is dereferenced."
