"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences input pointers a_indices, a_values, a_shape, and b without prior null checks. If any of these pointers are null, it will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a program crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can cause a crash or other unpredictable behavior.","The code directly dereferences the input Tensor pointers (a_indices, a_values, a_shape, b) without checking if they are NULL. If any of these pointers are NULL when the function is called, a null pointer dereference will occur, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior."
