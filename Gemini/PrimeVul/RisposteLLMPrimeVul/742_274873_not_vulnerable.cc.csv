"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a unit test that uses high-level API calls to a ComparisonOpModel. It does not contain any direct memory management operations, pointer arithmetic, or array indexing that could lead to common C/C++ vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or integer overflows. The input data and shapes are consistent, and the values used for uint8_t are within the valid range. The snippet itself appears robust and free of immediate security flaws."
