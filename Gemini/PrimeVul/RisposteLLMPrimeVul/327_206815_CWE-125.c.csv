"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product performs a write operation to a heap-allocated buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. This can lead to a crash, data corruption, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to populate image->colormap with unique colors. The image->colormap array is allocated to hold MaxColormapSize entries. The image->colors variable tracks the number of unique colors found and is used as an index into image->colormap. If the number of unique colors in the image exceeds MaxColormapSize, the image->colors variable will increment beyond MaxColormapSize-1. When image->colors becomes equal to MaxColormapSize, the subsequent write image->colormap[image->colors].red = ... will attempt to write one element past the end of the allocated image->colormap buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow."
"2","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The program attempts to write data past the end of a heap-allocated buffer. This can corrupt data, lead to a crash, or allow arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. In the first processing loop, the image->colormap array is allocated to a size of MaxColormapSize by AcquireImageColormap. Inside a critical section, the image->colors counter is incremented after being used as an index for image->colormap. If image->colors reaches MaxColormapSize, the subsequent write to image->colormap[image->colors] will attempt to access memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow."
