"1","True","CWE-693","Protection Mechanism Failure","The product contains a protection mechanism, but the mechanism can be bypassed or is otherwise ineffective.","The code attempts to bind to a specific address provided in the configuration (bind_address). However, regardless of whether this specific bind succeeds or fails, the code subsequently attempts to bind to the IPv6 'any' address (::) and the IPv4 'any' address (0.0.0.0). If these 'any' binds succeed, the service will listen on all available network interfaces, effectively overriding any intended restriction specified by the bind_address configuration. This can lead to unintended network exposure, where a service meant to be restricted to a specific IP address or interface becomes accessible from all interfaces."
