"1","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","The program accesses a memory location after it has been freed, which can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code passes pointers to string data owned by the `j_password` JSON object to the `user_update_password` function. After this call, `json_decref(j_password)` is invoked, which frees the memory backing these strings. If `user_update_password` or any subsequent code stores these pointers without making deep copies, a Use-After-Free vulnerability will occur when attempting to access the freed memory."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit of the product, denying service to legitimate users.","The code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to unchecked NULL pointer dereferences. Several calls to json_object_get are not followed by NULL checks before the returned value is used by functions like json_string_length, json_is_array, json_array_size, or json_string_value. An attacker can send a malformed JSON request body, omitting expected keys such as 'old_password', 'password', 'user', 'source', or 'username', which will cause json_object_get to return NULL. Subsequent operations on these NULL pointers will lead to application crashes."
