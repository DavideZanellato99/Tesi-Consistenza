"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet is not vulnerable. The initial check 'if (zroute >= sizeof(route_types)/sizeof(route_types[0]))' correctly performs a bounds check on the 'zroute' variable. If 'zroute' is out of bounds (too large), an error is logged, and the function returns. If the check passes, it guarantees that '0 <= zroute < sizeof(route_types)/sizeof(route_types[0])' (since 'zroute' is an unsigned integer), making subsequent accesses like 'route_types[zroute]' safe and within array boundaries. There are no apparent integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common weaknesses."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs a bounds check before accessing the `route_types` array using `zroute` as an index. The condition `if (zroute >= sizeof(route_types)/sizeof(route_types[0]))` ensures that `zroute` is within the valid index range of the array, preventing out-of-bounds access. The subsequent direct access `route_types[zroute]` and the linear search are therefore safe with respect to array indexing."
