"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The memset(end_data, 0, 7) call can lead to a buffer overflow. The data buffer has a fixed size of DATA_SIZE. The end_data pointer is initialized to data + line_size. Although line_size is checked to be less than or equal to DATA_SIZE, end_data can still point to data + DATA_SIZE if line_size equals DATA_SIZE and no trailing zeros are removed. In this case, memset(data + DATA_SIZE, 0, 7) attempts to write 7 bytes starting from one byte past the end of the allocated data buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior."

"5","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `data` buffer is allocated with `DATA_SIZE`. The `line_size` variable can be equal to `DATA_SIZE`. If `line_size` is `DATA_SIZE` and the last byte of the `data` buffer (`data[DATA_SIZE - 1]`) is not zero, the `end_data` pointer will point one byte past the end of the `data` buffer (`data + DATA_SIZE`). The subsequent call to `memset(end_data, 0, 7)` will then attempt to write 7 bytes starting from this out-of-bounds location, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. This can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior."
