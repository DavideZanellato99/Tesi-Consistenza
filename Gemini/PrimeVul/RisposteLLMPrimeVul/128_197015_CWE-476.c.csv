"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior. This can be exploited by attackers to cause a denial of service.","The code retrieves a track using gf_isom_get_track but does not check if the returned pointer (trak) is NULL before dereferencing it. If gf_isom_get_track returns NULL (e.g., due to an invalid track index or a malformed movie structure), the subsequent access to `trak->Media` will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash (denial of service) or other undefined behavior."

"3","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously initialized to NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The result of gf_isom_get_track(movie->moov, i+1) is not checked for NULL before being dereferenced multiple times (e.g., trak->Media, trak->sample_encryption). If gf_isom_get_track returns NULL, this will lead to a crash. Additionally, there is a memory leak: if gf_isom_box_new fails for writer->stsc or writer->stco, the previously allocated writer (and writer->stsc in the latter case) is not freed, as the function returns directly without reaching the cleanup logic at the exit label."
