"1","True","CWE-789","Uncontrolled Allocation of Memory in a Loop","The software allocates memory in a loop based on an input value, but it does not limit or throttle the allocation, which can lead to a denial-of-service.","The code reads `numTypes` from `getU32LEB()`, which likely parses untrusted input. This value directly controls the number of elements pushed into a `std::vector<Type>` within a loop. An attacker can provide an arbitrarily large `numTypes` value, causing the application to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service by exhausting system resources. There is no validation or limit on `numTypes` before memory allocation occurs."
