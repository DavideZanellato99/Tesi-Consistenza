"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code iterates through the 'ptr->views' array using 'ptr->num_views' as the upper bound. If 'ptr->num_views' is an untrusted value that exceeds the actual allocated size of the 'ptr->views' array, an out-of-bounds read will occur when accessing 'ptr->views[i]'. This can lead to a crash (Denial of Service) or potentially information disclosure if the out-of-bounds memory contains sensitive data."
