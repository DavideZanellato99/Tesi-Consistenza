"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to other weaknesses such as buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or denial of service.","The `pos += num_written;` operation can lead to an integer overflow. If the current file offset `pos` (a `loff_t`, typically 64-bit signed integer) is close to its maximum value and `num_written` (a `size_t`) is a positive value, their sum can exceed the maximum representable value for `loff_t`. This overflow would cause `pos` to wrap around to an incorrect, typically much smaller or negative, value. Subsequent write operations would then occur at an incorrect file offset, leading to data corruption. Additionally, `fuse_write_update_size` would be called with this incorrect `pos`, potentially setting an incorrect file size."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The `res` variable, of type `ssize_t`, accumulates the total number of bytes successfully written. If the system architecture uses a 32-bit signed integer for `ssize_t`, and a very large amount of data is written (exceeding SSIZE_MAX, which is approximately 2GB), `res` can overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This would cause the final return statement `res > 0 ? res : err;` to incorrectly evaluate `res > 0` as false, leading the function to return an error code (from `err`) instead of the actual (overflowed) number of bytes written. This misreporting of write success or failure can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior in the calling code."
