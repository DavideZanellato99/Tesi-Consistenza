"1","True","CWE-404","Improper Resource Shutdown or Release","The product does not release or incorrectly releases a system resource before it is no longer needed, which can cause the resource to be unavailable for other programs.","The code snippet calls `io_tw_lock` to acquire a lock but lacks a corresponding `io_tw_unlock` call within the function `io_req_task_cancel`. If `io_tw_lock` successfully acquires a lock and the subsequent function `io_req_complete_failed` does not release it, this will result in a missing unlock. This can lead to a deadlock, preventing other threads or processes from acquiring the same lock, effectively causing a denial of service."

"4","True","CWE-404","Improper Resource Shutdown or Release","The product does not release or incorrectly releases a system resource after its effective lifetime has ended, which can lead to resource exhaustion or other consequences.","The function acquires a lock via io_tw_lock but does not explicitly release it within the provided snippet. This can lead to resource exhaustion, deadlocks, or other concurrency issues if the lock is not properly released by subsequent operations or the calling function, potentially causing a denial of service."
