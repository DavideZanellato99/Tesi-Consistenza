"1","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","An off-by-one error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or too few, or when a buffer is allocated or accessed with an incorrect size that is off by one unit. This can lead to buffer overflows, buffer underflows, or incorrect processing of data.","The code passes sizeof(err_str) as the length argument to sctp_sf_abort_violation. For a C string literal, sizeof() includes the null terminator, making the passed length one byte larger than the actual string content. If sctp_sf_abort_violation expects the string length (excluding the null terminator) and uses this value for buffer operations, it could lead to a 1-byte buffer overflow, writing the null terminator out of bounds."
"2","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","An off-by-one error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few, or when a buffer is allocated one byte too short or one byte too long. This can lead to buffer overflows, buffer underflows, or incorrect program behavior.","The code passes sizeof(err_str) instead of strlen(err_str) to sctp_sf_abort_violation. sizeof includes the null terminator, causing an off-by-one error where the length reported or used for the error string is one byte larger than the actual string content. This can lead to a one-byte buffer overflow if the receiving function allocates a buffer based on strlen but copies strlen + 1 bytes, or result in malformed network packets and potential denial of service on the receiving end due to incorrect length parsing."
