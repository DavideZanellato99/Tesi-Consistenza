"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be larger and it wraps to a smaller number. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or buffer sizing.","The code calculates xQueueSizeInBytes = uxQueueLength * uxItemSize and includes an assert to detect overflow in this specific multiplication. However, the subsequent memory allocation call pvPortMalloc( sizeof( Queue_t ) + xQueueSizeInBytes ) does not include a check for integer overflow in the sum sizeof( Queue_t ) + xQueueSizeInBytes. If xQueueSizeInBytes is sufficiently large, this addition can overflow, causing pvPortMalloc to allocate a smaller buffer than intended. This undersized allocation can then lead to a heap-based buffer overflow when the queue storage area is accessed and written to, potentially allowing an attacker to corrupt memory."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer multiplication is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type, leading to a truncation of the result. This can cause a buffer to be allocated with an undersized capacity, leading to a heap buffer overflow when data is written beyond the allocated bounds.","The code calculates the total memory required for the queue as sizeof( Queue_t ) + xQueueSizeInBytes. While xQueueSizeInBytes is checked for multiplication overflow, the subsequent addition of sizeof( Queue_t ) to xQueueSizeInBytes is not checked. If xQueueSizeInBytes is sufficiently large (close to the maximum value of size_t), this addition can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-intended size being passed to pvPortMalloc. This leads to an undersized buffer being allocated, which can then be exploited via a heap-based buffer overflow when data is written into the queue storage area."
