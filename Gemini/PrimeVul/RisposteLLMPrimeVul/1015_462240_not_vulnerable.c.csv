"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or information disclosure.","The code performs an out-of-bounds read if the provided 'pos' parameter, when incremented by 1, exceeds the allocated size of the 'buf' buffer. The function lacks any bounds checking, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary memory locations beyond the buffer's boundary, potentially leading to information disclosure or a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code snippet performs an out-of-bounds read if the provided position 'pos' plus one exceeds the allocated size of the 'buf' buffer. There is no bounds checking performed within the function, making it susceptible to reading data from adjacent memory locations, which can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other undefined behavior."
