"1","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished with the resource's effective lifetime, which can lead to a resource leak.","The code has a file descriptor leak. If fdopen fails, the file descriptor 'fd' returned by g_file_open_tmp is not closed, leading to a resource leak. The file descriptor remains open even though the program can no longer use it."

"4","True","CWE-772","Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","The product does not release a system resource after it has finished using the resource, which can lead to resource exhaustion.","The code creates a temporary file using g_file_open_tmp, obtaining a file descriptor (fd). It then attempts to convert this file descriptor into a FILE* stream using fdopen. If fdopen fails (i.e., context->file is NULL), the allocated context and temporary filename are freed, but the original file descriptor (fd) is not closed. This results in a file descriptor leak. Repeated failures to open the file stream could lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing a denial of service."
