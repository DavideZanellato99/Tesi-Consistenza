"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of an integer operation is larger than the maximum size that can be stored in the integer type, leading to a wraparound to a small, positive number or a negative number. This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.","The code calculates the total memory required as elem_size * smap->map.max_entries. If elem_size and smap->map.max_entries are sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum value representable by a u32, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow would cause bpf_map_area_alloc to allocate a much smaller buffer than intended. Subsequently, pcpu_freelist_populate would attempt to populate the freelist using the original, larger elem_size and smap->map.max_entries values, leading to out-of-bounds writes or reads on the undersized buffer, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow."
