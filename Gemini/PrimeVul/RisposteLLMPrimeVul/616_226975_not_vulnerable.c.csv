"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet does not appear to have any immediate security vulnerabilities. The IRC_PROTOCOL_MIN_ARGS(4) macro is assumed to correctly validate that at least 4 arguments are present, preventing an out-of-bounds read when accessing argv_eol[3]. The weechat_printf_date_tags function uses a static format string with only %s specifiers, and all corresponding arguments are strings, which prevents format string vulnerabilities. No other common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or integer overflows are evident in this snippet."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code uses `weechat_printf_date_tags` to print a message that includes user-controlled input from `argv_eol[3]`.
