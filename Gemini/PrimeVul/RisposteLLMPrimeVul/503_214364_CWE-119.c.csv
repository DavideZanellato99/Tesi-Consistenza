"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product contains a ""divide by zero"" error. This occurs when a program attempts to divide a number by zero, which is an undefined operation.","The code is vulnerable to a division-by-zero error and a memory leak. If a previous call to realloc fails, target->str is set to NULL and target->size to 0. In a subsequent call, if simplestring_init_str also fails to allocate or sets target->size to 0, then incr will be 0. The expression newsize % incr will then cause a division-by-zero error. Additionally, if realloc fails, it returns NULL but does not free the original memory. The code then assigns NULL to target->str, losing the pointer to the original buffer and causing a memory leak."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the result of the calculation will always be larger than the original value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The calculation of newsize using target->len + add_len + 1 is susceptible to integer overflow. If target->len and add_len are sufficiently large, their sum can exceed the maximum value for an int, causing newsize to wrap around to a small positive or negative value. If newsize becomes a small positive value, realloc will allocate a buffer much smaller than required. Subsequently, the memcpy operation will attempt to copy add_len bytes into this undersized buffer, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow."
