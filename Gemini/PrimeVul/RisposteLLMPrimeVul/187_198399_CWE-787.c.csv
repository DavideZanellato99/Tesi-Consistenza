"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer's size is less than or equal to the output buffer's size, causing a buffer overflow.","The code uses sprintf to construct an IP address string into a fixed-size buffer addr (INET_ADDRSTRLEN). The integer values a, b, c, d are read from user input via sscanf. If these integer values are sufficiently large (e.g., INT_MAX), their string representation will exceed the addr buffer when formatted by sprintf, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker can provide large integer values in the PORT command argument to trigger this overflow, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The return value of sscanf is also not checked, which could lead to uninitialized variables being used."
