"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code processes a compiled regular expression pattern. When handling Unicode properties (e.g., PT_BOOL, PT_SCX, PT_SC, PT_GC), it uses values from the input stream (specifically cc[1]) as an index or offset into internal data structures such as PRIV(ucd_boolprop_sets), PRIV(ucd_script_sets), and PRIV(ucp_typerange). If an attacker provides a crafted regular expression pattern where cc[1] contains a sufficiently large value, it can lead to an out-of-bounds read from these internal arrays. This can result in information leakage, denial of service (crash), or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and subsequent use of the read data. Additionally, the primary loop iterating over 'cc' lacks explicit bounds checking, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read if the XCL_END marker is missing or delayed in a malicious pattern."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to a crash, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code accesses internal Unicode data tables (e.g., PRIV(ucd_caseless_sets), PRIV(ucd_boolprop_sets), PRIV(ucd_script_sets)) using an index derived from cc[1]. The value of cc[1] is read directly from the compiled regular expression pattern. If an attacker can provide a specially crafted regular expression, they can control the value of cc[1]. If this value is sufficiently large, it can cause an out-of-bounds read from these internal data tables, potentially leading to information disclosure or a denial of service (crash)."
