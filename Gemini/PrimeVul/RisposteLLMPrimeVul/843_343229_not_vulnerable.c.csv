"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The overlapcpy function copies data from a source buffer to a destination buffer without performing any bounds checking on the destination. If the source string is larger than the allocated memory for the destination buffer, this will result in a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior."
