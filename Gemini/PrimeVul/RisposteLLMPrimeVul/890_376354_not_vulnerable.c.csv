"1","True","CWE-327","Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","The software uses a cryptographic algorithm that is no longer considered strong enough for its intended purpose. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity.","The function provides options for cryptographically weak hash algorithms such as MD2, MD5, and SHA1. While the function itself is a simple lookup, its inclusion of these algorithms enables a calling application to use them, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if used in contexts requiring strong cryptographic guarantees."
"2","True","CWE-327","Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","The product uses a cryptographic algorithm that is known to be broken or to have a security weakness.","The gpg_hash_str function allows the selection of cryptographically weak hash algorithms like MD2 and MD5. While the function itself does not perform cryptographic operations, it provides the means to specify these broken algorithms, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the overall system's security if used by a calling application."
