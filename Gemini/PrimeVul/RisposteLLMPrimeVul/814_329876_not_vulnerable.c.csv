"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code contains a do-while loop that iterates over 'spans'. The loop condition is 'while (--num_spans > 1)'. Inside the loop, 'spans[0]' and 'spans[1]' are accessed to calculate 'len = spans[1].x - spans[0].x;'. If 'num_spans' is 1, the do block executes once. 'spans[0]' is a valid access, but 'spans[1]' attempts to read beyond the bounds of the 'spans' array, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in a crash, unpredictable behavior, or information disclosure."

"4","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end of, or before the beginning of, the intended buffer.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. When the `num_spans` parameter is 1, the `do-while` loop executes once. Inside this iteration, `spans[0]` is accessed correctly, but `spans[1]` is also accessed to calculate the `len` variable. Since `num_spans` is 1, the `spans` array only contains one element at index 0, making the access to `spans[1]` an out-of-bounds read. This vulnerability exists in both the `h == 1` and `h > 1` branches of the code."
