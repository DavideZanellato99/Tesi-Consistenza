"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to NULL. This typically causes a program crash or denial of service.","The function does not check if the input 'rose_node' is NULL before attempting to dereference 'rose_node->next'. If 'rose_node' is NULL and matches a node in the list (either the head 'rose_node_list' or a subsequent node 's->next'), the code will attempt to access 'NULL->next', leading to a NULL pointer dereference and likely a program crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously freed, or that was never assigned, or that has been set to NULL.","The function does not check if the input 'rose_node' pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. If 'rose_node' is NULL and 'rose_node_list' is also NULL, the line 'rose_node_list = rose_node->next;' will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
