"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code reads a size 'sz' from the binary buffer and then attempts to read 'sz' bytes into a dynamically allocated buffer 'name' using 'r_buf_read_at'. The return value of 'r_buf_read_at', which indicates the number of bytes actually read, is not checked. If 'r_buf_read_at' reads fewer than 'sz' bytes (e.g., due to reaching the end of the 'bin->buf'), the program's offset 'off' is still incremented by the full 'sz'. This desynchronizes the parser's position from the actual data, causing subsequent reads to occur at incorrect, potentially out-of-bounds, locations relative to the intended binary structure. An attacker could craft a malformed NE binary to exploit this logic error, leading to misinterpretation of data, information disclosure, or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a location that is past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code uses ut16 off as an offset into bin->buf. This offset is incremented by sz (an ut8 value) and 2. If off is close to UT16_MAX, adding sz or 2 can cause off to wrap around due to integer overflow. This wrapped off value, or an off + sz value that exceeds the buffer's bounds, is then used in r_buf_read_at functions without explicit bounds checking. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious input file that causes the program to read data from arbitrary memory locations outside the intended buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
