"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet correctly handles user-space memory interactions and length checks. It uses `copy_to_user` and `put_user` for safe data transfer to user-space, which are designed to prevent kernel panics or information leaks due to invalid user pointers. The `scontext_len > len` check correctly identifies if the user-provided buffer is too small, returning -ERANGE and providing the actual required length to the user. Memory allocated for `scontext` is properly freed using `kfree`. No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common vulnerabilities are apparent in this snippet."

"4","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles user-provided buffer sizes and pointers. The 'len' parameter acts as an upper bound for the copy, and the actual data length 'scontext_len' is used for 'copy_to_user', ensuring that no more data than available or requested is copied. The check 'scontext_len > len' correctly prevents kernel from writing beyond the user's declared buffer capacity by returning -ERANGE. Standard kernel functions like 'copy_to_user' and 'put_user' are used for user-space interaction, which are designed to safely handle user-space memory access and return errors like -EFAULT if user-space pointers become invalid or memory mappings change, preventing kernel memory corruption. Memory allocated for 'scontext' is properly freed with kfree."
