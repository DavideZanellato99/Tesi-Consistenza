"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code allocates a boolean array 'outputs_required' of size 'n->num_outputs()'. It then iterates through outgoing edges and uses 'e->src_output()' as an index into this array. While there is a check 'e->src_output() >= 0', there is no check to ensure that 'e->src_output()' is less than 'n->num_outputs()'. If an edge's 'src_output' attribute is greater than or equal to 'n->num_outputs()', accessing 'outputs_required[e->src_output()]' will result in an an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory or leading to a crash."
"2","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource.","The code processes graph nodes and their attributes, including ""frame_name"". An attacker can craft a graph with a large number of unique ""frame_name"" attributes, leading to the creation of an excessive number of entries in the `frame_info_` map. Each entry in this map allocates a `std::string` for the key and a `std::unique_ptr<FrameInfo>` (which itself contains a `std::vector` and `PendingCountsLayout`), consuming significant memory and potentially leading to a Denial of Service."
