"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly calculates and updates a message digest using SHA256. It properly handles buffer sizes for hash operations and iterates through lists of certificate hashes and SPKIs, calculating the correct byte lengths for each update. Error conditions are handled by assertions, preventing continued execution on failure. No buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory safety issues were identified within this snippet."

"3","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly calculates and updates a message digest. It uses appropriate cryptographic functions (EVP_sha256, EVP_DigestUpdate) and performs necessary length checks (SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH) and error handling (RELEASE_ASSERT). Buffer sizes are correctly managed; hash_buffer is sufficiently large for SHA256 digests, and data lengths passed to EVP_DigestUpdate are derived from the actual size of the data being hashed, preventing buffer overflows or underflows during the digest update process. There are no apparent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or cryptographic misuses within the provided code."
