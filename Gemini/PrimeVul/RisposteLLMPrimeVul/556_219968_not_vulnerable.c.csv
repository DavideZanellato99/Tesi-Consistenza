"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically leads to a crash or exit of the program, which can be exploited for a denial of service.","The code calls json_object_get(j_scope_list, ""grant"") and directly passes its return value to ulfius_set_json_body_response. If j_scope_list does not contain the key ""grant"" or if the ""grant"" key is not present, json_object_get will return NULL. Passing this NULL pointer to ulfius_set_json_body_response without a prior null check could lead to a null pointer dereference, resulting in a crash and a Denial of Service."
"2","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.","The code passes a borrowed reference from json_object_get(j_scope_list, ""grant"") to ulfius_set_json_body_response. The ulfius_set_json_body_response function expects an owned reference and stores this pointer for later use within the response object. Immediately after this call, json_decref(j_scope_list) is invoked. If j_scope_list's reference count drops to zero, it and its sub-objects (including the one passed to ulfius_set_json_body_response) are freed. This results in the ulfius framework holding a dangling pointer. When ulfius later attempts to json_decref or access this stored pointer (e.g., during response cleanup or serialization), it will attempt to access freed memory, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability."
