"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from a downstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component for execution.","The code copies a user-provided string into a kernel buffer that defines the path to a cgroup release agent. This path is later executed by the kernel when a cgroup becomes empty. While strlcpy prevents buffer overflows and strstrip removes whitespace, there is no validation of the content of the path itself to ensure it points to a trusted executable or a safe location. If an unprivileged user can write to this kernfs file, they can specify an arbitrary executable path. When the kernel executes this path, it typically does so with elevated privileges, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. This is a form of OS command injection where the 'command' is the path to an executable."

Although `strlcpy` prevents buffer overflows and `strstrip` removes leading/trailing whitespace, it does not filter out shell metacharacters.
