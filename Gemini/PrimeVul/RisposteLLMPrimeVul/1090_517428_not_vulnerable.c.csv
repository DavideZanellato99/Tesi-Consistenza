"1","True","CWE-284","Improper Access Control","The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.","The doGet function dispatches requests to various handler functions based on the ACTION macro. The provided snippet does not include explicit authorization or authentication checks before invoking potentially sensitive actions such as handle_runtime, print_status, print_summary, or _printReport. If these actions can be triggered by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user, it could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized execution of privileged operations. The vulnerability lies in the potential lack of access control for these actions."
"2","True","CWE-862","Missing Authorization","The software does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.","The code snippet dispatches requests to various handler functions based on an ACTION macro. It lacks explicit authentication and authorization checks before dispatching to potentially sensitive actions such as RUNTIME, STATUS, SUMMARY, or REPORT. If these actions can be triggered by unauthenticated or unauthorized users, it could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized execution of operations, indicating a missing authorization vulnerability."
