"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash, corrupt data, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a double free. If flatview_unref is called multiple times on the same FlatView object after its reference count has reached zero and flatview_destroy has been called (which presumably frees the view object's memory), subsequent calls will attempt to access and modify freed memory (view->ref--) and potentially call flatview_destroy again on the already freed memory, leading to a double free."
"2","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.","The reference counting mechanism is vulnerable to a double free. If flatview_unref is called multiple times on the same FlatView object after its reference count has already reached zero and flatview_destroy has been invoked, it will attempt to free the same memory region again. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
