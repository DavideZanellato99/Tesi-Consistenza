"1","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software contains a recursive function that does not sufficiently limit the depth of recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow.","The gdImageFillToBorder function uses a recursive algorithm for flood filling. If the image contains a large, contiguous area or a complex shape that forces deep recursion, it can make an excessive number of nested calls. This can exhaust the program's call stack, leading to a stack overflow and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software does not adequately control the depth of recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow or other resource exhaustion issues. An attacker can provide input that causes the program to recurse to an excessive depth, consuming all available stack memory and causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.","The gdImageFillToBorder function implements a recursive flood fill algorithm. If an attacker provides a specially crafted image with a complex or deeply nested fill area, the uncontrolled recursion depth can lead to excessive stack memory consumption. This can result in a stack overflow, causing the application to crash and leading to a denial of service."
