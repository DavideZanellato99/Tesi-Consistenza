"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been assigned NULL, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences the 'ept' pointer to access 'ept->rpdev' without first checking if 'ept' is NULL. If 'ept' is a NULL pointer, this will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a program crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The function passes the 'data' pointer and 'len' parameter directly to 'rpmsg_send_offchannel_raw' without validating 'len' against the actual size of the buffer pointed to by 'data'. If 'len' is controlled by an untrusted source and exceeds the buffer's capacity, it can lead to a buffer overflow in the downstream function, allowing for potential memory corruption or arbitrary code execution."
