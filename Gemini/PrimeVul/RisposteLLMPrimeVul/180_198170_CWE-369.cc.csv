"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit in the application, or to a state that could be exploited by an attacker.","The code retrieves the 'bias' tensor using GetOptionalInputTensor, which can return a null pointer if the bias tensor is not provided. Subsequently, the code attempts to dereference this 'bias' pointer by calling GetTensorShape(bias) and GetTensorData<float>(bias) (or GetTensorData<int32_t>(bias) in other branches) without first checking if 'bias' is null. This will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service if the optional bias tensor is absent."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains a loop that dequantizes weights_time from int8_t to float. The loop iterates based on NumElements(float_weights_time), which is the size of the destination buffer. If the source buffer, weights_time, has fewer elements than float_weights_time (i.e., NumElements(weights_time) < NumElements(float_weights_time)), then weights_time_ptr[i] will attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory for weights_time, leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can result in information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
