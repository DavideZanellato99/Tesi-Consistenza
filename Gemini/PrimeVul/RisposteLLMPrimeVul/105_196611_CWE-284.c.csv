"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other issues if the input is used in a security-sensitive context without proper sanitization or length checks.","The code uses snprintf to construct a lock file path into a fixed-size buffer cl.lockfile. While snprintf prevents buffer overflows by truncating the output, it uses sizeof(cl.lockfile)-1 as the buffer size argument, which is slightly off but safe. The primary vulnerability arises if booth_conf->name, which is used in the path construction, can be excessively long and is not validated for length. In such a scenario, the resulting lock file name in cl.lockfile will be truncated. This truncation can lead to security vulnerabilities such as race conditions or denial of service if multiple configurations or processes end up using the same truncated lock file name, or if the truncated name is predictable or collides with an attacker-controlled path. The lack of proper length validation on booth_conf->name before its use in path construction is the underlying issue."
