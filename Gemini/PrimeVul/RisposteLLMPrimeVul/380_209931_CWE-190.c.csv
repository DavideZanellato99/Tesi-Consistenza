"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than the maximum value that can be represented in the intended storage type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows if the result is used in memory allocation or indexing.","The calculation `width * height * 4` to determine the size for `surfaceData` can lead to an integer overflow if `width` and `height` are sufficiently large UINT32 values. If an overflow occurs, the resulting size passed to `BufferPool_Take` will be smaller than the actual required memory. This undersized buffer can then be subject to a heap-based buffer overflow when data is written into `ret->surfaceData` by subsequent operations, such as `video->createSurface` or later rendering logic, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product uses or calculates a number that is larger than the maximum value intended to be stored in a container for that number, which can cause the number to wrap around to a significantly smaller value or become a negative value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The calculation width * height * 4 for allocating surfaceData can lead to an integer overflow if width and height are sufficiently large. Since width and height are UINT32, their product multiplied by 4 could exceed the maximum value of UINT32, causing the result to wrap around to a smaller value. This would cause BufferPool_Take to allocate an undersized buffer. Subsequent operations writing to ret->surfaceData based on the original, larger dimensions could then result in a heap buffer overflow, leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
