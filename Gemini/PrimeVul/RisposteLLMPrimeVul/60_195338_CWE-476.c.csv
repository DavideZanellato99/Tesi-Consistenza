"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. When updating an existing parameter set, if the call to gf_realloc(sl->data, size) fails (e.g., due to out-of-memory conditions or an excessively large size), it will return NULL. This NULL value is then immediately assigned to sl->data. The subsequent memcpy(sl->data, data, size) attempts to write to this NULL pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not handle the NULL value. This typically causes a program to crash or terminate.","The code reallocates memory for sl->data using gf_realloc. If gf_realloc fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), it returns NULL, which is then assigned to sl->data without a check. The subsequent memcpy operation attempts to dereference sl->data, which could now be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a program crash."
