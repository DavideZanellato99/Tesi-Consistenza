"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, corruption of data, or information disclosure.","The code attempts to read the first element of the `concat_dim_t` tensor using `concat_dim_t->flat<int32>()(0)` or `concat_dim_t->flat<int64_t>()(0)` without first verifying that the tensor is not empty. If an attacker provides an empty tensor for `concat_dim_t`, this will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash (denial of service) or potential information disclosure."

"5","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or control flow.","The code calculates the output shape for concatenation by summing dimension sizes using c->Add(output_middle, middle, &output_middle). If the sum of DimensionHandle values (which can be int64_t) exceeds the maximum value for int64_t, and the c->Add function does not explicitly handle this overflow by returning an error or an unknown dimension, the output_middle dimension could wrap around to an incorrect, smaller value. This incorrect dimension could then be used to allocate a buffer that is too small for the concatenated tensor, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer overflow if subsequent operations write data beyond the allocated memory region."
