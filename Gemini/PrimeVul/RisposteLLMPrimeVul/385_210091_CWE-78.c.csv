"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from a downstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is executed.","The code is vulnerable to OS command injection in the systemd path. The 'prompt' argument is directly incorporated into a shell command executed via popen without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious 'prompt' string containing shell metacharacters, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution."
