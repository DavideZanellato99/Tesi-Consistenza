"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been intentionally set to NULL, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences pointers rm and rd without checking if they are NULL. If either rm or rd is a NULL pointer, dereferencing it will lead to a segmentation fault, causing a denial of service."
