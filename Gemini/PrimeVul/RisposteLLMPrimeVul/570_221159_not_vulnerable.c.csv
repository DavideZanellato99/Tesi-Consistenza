"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit condition.","The function dereferences the 'sd' pointer without checking if it is NULL. If a NULL pointer is passed as an argument, accessing 'sd->font_count' or 'sd->fonts' will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, typically because the pointer was not initialized or was explicitly set to NULL. This often leads to a crash or denial of service, but can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.","The function does not check if the input pointer 'sd' is NULL before dereferencing it to access 'sd->font_count' and 'sd->fonts'. If 'sd' is NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
