"1","True","CWE-400","Uncontrolled Resource Consumption","The product does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are used, which can be controlled by an actor to consume enough resources to cause a denial of service.","The code copies all WebPageProxy references from m_pageMap into a temporary vector and then iterates over them. If an attacker can control the number of WebPageProxy objects (e.g., by opening many browser tabs or windows), this operation can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CPU time and memory) during the copy and iteration. This could result in a denial of service, making the WebProcessProxy unresponsive or causing it to crash due to excessive resource usage."
"2","True","CWE-770","Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","The software allocates resources, such as memory or file handles, based on external input, but it does not limit or throttle the allocation, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code copies all entries from m_pageMap into a local vector and then iterates over them. If the number of WebPageProxy objects in m_pageMap can be controlled by an attacker (e.g., by opening many tabs or windows), this operation could lead to excessive memory allocation for the 'pages' vector and significant CPU consumption during the copy and iteration, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion. There are no apparent limits or throttling mechanisms to prevent an attacker from exhausting system resources."
