"1","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string with a function such as printf() or sprintf(), but the format string is controlled by an external input. This can allow an attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.","The luaG_runerror function uses the fmt argument directly as a format string for luaO_pushvfstring. If an attacker can control the value of fmt, they can inject format string specifiers (e.g., %x, %n) to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-134","Use of Externally-Controlled Format String","The product uses a format string that is obtained from an untrusted source, which can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code or read sensitive information from the stack.","The function luaG_runerror takes a format string 'fmt' and passes it directly to luaO_pushvfstring, which is a variadic format string function. If the 'fmt' argument can be controlled by an attacker, this could lead to a format string vulnerability, allowing for information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
