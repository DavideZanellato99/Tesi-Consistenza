"1","True","CWE-200","Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor","The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This can occur through various means, including improper access control, insufficient data protection, or unintended information disclosure.","The code exposes a constant reference to an internal WifiNetworkVector object. If this vector contains sensitive information such as Wi-Fi passwords or security keys, and this method is accessible to unauthorized entities without proper access control, it could lead to an information leak, allowing full read access to the sensitive data."
"2","True","CWE-200","Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor","The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.","The getter method returns a constant reference to a collection of Wi-Fi networks. If the WifiNetworkVector contains sensitive information such as network credentials, pre-shared keys, or private configuration details, this method allows any caller to read this sensitive data. Although the reference is constant, it does not prevent the observation and disclosure of the sensitive information, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability if proper access controls are not in place for the object containing this method."
