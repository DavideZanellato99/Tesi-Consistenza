"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an excessive amount of data to a heap-based buffer, which can overwrite adjacent heap memory. This can corrupt data, lead to a crash, or allow arbitrary code execution.","The function pkey_GOST_ECcp_encrypt calls i2d_GOST_KEY_TRANSPORT to serialize data into the out buffer. The return value of i2d_GOST_KEY_TRANSPORT, which indicates the required size, is only used to update *out_len after the serialization attempt. There is no check before the call to i2d_GOST_KEY_TRANSPORT to ensure that the out buffer, provided by the caller, is large enough to hold the serialized data. If a caller provides an out buffer that is too small, i2d_GOST_KEY_TRANSPORT will write past the end of this buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow if out points to a heap-allocated buffer."
