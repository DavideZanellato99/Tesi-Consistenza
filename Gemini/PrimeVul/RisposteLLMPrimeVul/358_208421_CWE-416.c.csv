"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is stored in a smaller integer type than the calculation was performed in, or when the result exceeds the maximum value for the integer type, leading to a loss of precision or unexpected behavior.","The code uses `int` variables (`start_skip`, `end_skip`, `count`, `added`, `i`) to store results of calculations involving `linenr_T` (long) variables. On systems where `long` is 64-bit and `int` is 32-bit, these assignments can lead to integer truncation if the calculated values (e.g., differences between large line numbers) exceed the maximum value of an `int`. This truncation can cause incorrect line number calculations, leading to unintended deletion or insertion of lines, or operations on incorrect buffer regions, potentially corrupting buffer content or leading to unexpected behavior."
