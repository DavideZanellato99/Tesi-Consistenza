"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to access x_tensor->dim_size(1) and cs_prev_tensor->dim_size(1) to determine input_size and cell_size respectively. However, the validation checks for the rank of these tensors (e.g., x_tensor->dims() == 2) occur much later in the function. If an attacker provides an input tensor for 'x' or 'cs_prev' that has fewer than two dimensions (e.g., a 1-dimensional tensor), accessing dim_size(1) will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash and a denial-of-service vulnerability."

"5","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code attempts to extract dimensions using `x_tensor->dim_size(1)` and `cs_prev_tensor->dim_size(1)` before verifying that these tensors have at least two dimensions. The `OP_REQUIRES` checks for `x_tensor->dims() == 2` and `cs_prev_tensor->dims() == 2` occur later in the function. If an input tensor (e.g., `x_tensor` or `cs_prev_tensor`) has fewer than two dimensions (e.g., rank 0 or 1), accessing `dim_size(1)` will result in an out-of-bounds read, leading to undefined behavior, potential crashes, or information disclosure."
