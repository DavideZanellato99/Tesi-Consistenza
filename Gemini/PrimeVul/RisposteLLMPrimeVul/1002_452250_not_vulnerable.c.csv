"1","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software uses external input to construct a filename or path that is used to access a file or directory. If the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the filename or path, an attacker can control which file is accessed.","The code directly uses the 'uri' parameter, obtained from user input via zend_parse_parameters, as the filename for xsltSaveResultToFilename without any validation or sanitization. An attacker can provide an arbitrary file path, including directory traversal sequences, to write the transformed XML content to any location on the server where the PHP process has write permissions. This can lead to arbitrary file write, potentially overwriting critical system files, configuration files, or web application files, resulting in denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution."
"2","True","CWE-73","External Control of File Name or Path","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is used to access a file or directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that could cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the intended directory.","The code uses the 'uri' parameter, which is directly controlled by user input, as the filename for 'xsltSaveResultToFilename'. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server, leading to an arbitrary file write vulnerability. An attacker could create new files or overwrite existing files in sensitive locations, potentially leading to remote code execution, data corruption, or denial of service."
