"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The function get_user_pages takes 'pages' and 'vmas' as pointers to arrays where it stores page and VMA pointers. The 'len' parameter specifies the number of pages to process, which dictates how many elements will be written into these arrays. The function increments an index 'i' from 0 up to 'len-1' and uses it to access 'pages[i]' and 'vmas[i]'. However, there is no bounds checking performed on the 'pages' or 'vmas' arrays against the 'len' parameter. If the caller provides arrays that are smaller than 'len' elements, the function will write past the end of these allocated buffers, leading to an out-of-bounds write."

"4","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The code iterates 'len' times, writing to 'pages[i]' and 'vmas[i]' without validating that the 'pages' and 'vmas' arrays, provided by the caller, are large enough to accommodate 'len' elements. If the caller provides arrays smaller than 'len', an out-of-bounds write will occur, leading to memory corruption and potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution."
