"1","True","CWE-693","Protection Mechanism Failure","The product contains a protection mechanism that can be bypassed or rendered ineffective.","The code attempts to restrict socket families using seccomp rules but explicitly notes that ""Socket filtering doesn't work on e.g. i386, so ignore failures here"". Critically, the return value of `seccomp_rule_add_exact` is not checked within the socket filtering loop. This means if `seccomp_rule_add_exact` fails to apply a rule (e.g., due to an unsupported architecture or libseccomp limitation), the function will continue without error, and the intended network restrictions will not be enforced. This allows an application inside the sandbox to potentially create sockets of families that were meant to be blocked, bypassing a security control."
"2","True","CWE-754","Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions","The product does not properly check for or handle unusual or exceptional conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. In the context of a security mechanism like a seccomp filter, this can manifest as a failure to anticipate and block all dangerous syscalls or argument combinations, especially as the underlying kernel API evolves.","The seccomp filter is configured using a blocklist approach, starting with SCMP_ACT_ALLOW and then explicitly denying known dangerous syscalls and argument combinations. While the blocklist is extensive and proactively addresses many known attack vectors and new kernel features, this approach inherently carries a risk. Any new or previously unknown dangerous syscall, or a novel way to combine existing syscalls or arguments not explicitly covered by the blocklist, would be implicitly allowed. This reliance on a perfectly comprehensive blocklist in an evolving kernel environment makes the sandbox susceptible to future bypasses if the filter is not continuously updated to cover all potential escape routes."
