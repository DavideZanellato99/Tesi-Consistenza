"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been freed. This typically causes a program crash or exit, which is a denial of service.","The code retrieves a context pointer ctx from gf_filter_get_udta(filter) and then dereferences it multiple times (e.g., ctx->sps, ctx->pps, ctx->nal_length) without checking if ctx is NULL. If gf_filter_get_udta(filter) returns a NULL pointer, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, often resulting in a crash or denial of service. This typically happens when a pointer is initialized to NULL and then used without being assigned a valid memory address or without being checked for NULL before dereferencing.","The code retrieves a context pointer ctx from gf_filter_get_udta(filter). If gf_filter_get_udta returns NULL, the subsequent dereferences of ctx at ctx->sps = gf_list_new(); and ctx->pps = gf_list_new(); will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or denial of service. The snippet lacks a check for a NULL return value from gf_filter_get_udta before using ctx."
