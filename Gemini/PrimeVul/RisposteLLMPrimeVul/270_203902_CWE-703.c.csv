"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can occur when the size of the input buffer is not explicitly provided or is incorrectly assumed, allowing an attacker to provide an input larger than the allocated output buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.","The code snippet uses ga_concat to append data from sp->buflines. If the strings stored in sp->buflines.ga_data are not guaranteed to be null-terminated, and ga_concat internally relies on strlen or a similar function to determine the length of the string to be appended, it could lead to a buffer over-read. This over-read could then cause ga_concat to attempt to copy an excessive amount of data, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow in the ga buffer. The snippet itself does not validate the null-termination of the strings retrieved from sp->buflines.ga_data before passing them to ga_concat."

"4","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be larger than it is, or that it has not wrapped around. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The integer variable 'len' is calculated by adding 'ga.ga_len' and the result of 'STRLEN' cast to an integer. If the sum of 'ga.ga_len' and the string length exceeds the maximum value for an 'int', an integer overflow will occur. This overflow will cause 'len' to wrap around to an incorrect value. Subsequent array accesses using this corrupted 'len', such as 'buf[len - 1]' or 'buf[len - 2]', could then lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
