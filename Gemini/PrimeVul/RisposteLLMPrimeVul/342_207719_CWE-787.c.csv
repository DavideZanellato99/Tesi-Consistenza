"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The function uses the input parameter 'col' in pointer arithmetic (p + col) without validating it against the actual length of the current line obtained from ml_get_curline(). If 'col' exceeds the line's length, 'p + col' will point beyond the allocated buffer. The subsequent call to (*mb_head_off)(p, p + col) will then attempt to read from this out-of-bounds memory location, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability which can cause a crash (Denial of Service) or information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code calculates a pointer p + col without validating that col is within the bounds of the current line buffer p. If col exceeds the actual length of the line, the subsequent call to (*mb_head_off)(p, p + col) will attempt to access memory out-of-bounds of the buffer pointed to by p. This out-of-bounds read can lead to a denial of service or information disclosure."
