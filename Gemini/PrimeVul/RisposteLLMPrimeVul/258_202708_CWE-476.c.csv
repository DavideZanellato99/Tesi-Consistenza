"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been assigned NULL, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences the 'rmp' pointer at 'rmp->rm_ic = p_fic || ignore_case;' without checking if 'rmp' is NULL. If 'rmp' is a null pointer, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash or undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not handle the resulting error.","The function fname_match dereferences the rmp pointer without checking if it is NULL. Specifically, the line rmp->rm_ic = p_fic || ignore_case; will cause a null pointer dereference if rmp is a null pointer and name is not null. This can lead to a crash or denial of service."
