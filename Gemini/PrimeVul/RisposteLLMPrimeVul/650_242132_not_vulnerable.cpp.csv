"1","True","CWE-285","Improper Authorization","The software does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.","The code allows setting a boolean value for an arbitrary key. While a CHECK_SETTING_SECURITY macro is present, its implementation is not provided. If this security check is insufficient, can be bypassed, or is incorrectly implemented, an unauthorized actor could modify sensitive application settings, leading to a compromise of application integrity or behavior."
"2","True","CWE-284","Improper Access Control","The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.","The code allows a Lua script to set arbitrary boolean configuration settings via the 'key' parameter. Although a 'CHECK_SETTING_SECURITY' macro is present, its implementation is not provided. If this security check is insufficient or bypassable, an attacker could modify sensitive application settings that should not be exposed or modifiable by untrusted scripts. This could lead to unauthorized changes in application behavior, potentially resulting in privilege escalation, denial of service, or information disclosure."
