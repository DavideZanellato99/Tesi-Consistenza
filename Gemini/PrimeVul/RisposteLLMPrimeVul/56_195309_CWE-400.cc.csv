"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer without properly checking the size of the input, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to denial of service, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The statement line[llen + 1] = '\0'; attempts to null-terminate the line buffer. When gopherState->len is zero, the llen variable can be set to TEMP_BUF_SIZE - 1 due to a preceding truncation logic. In this specific case, llen + 1 evaluates to TEMP_BUF_SIZE, resulting in an out-of-bounds write one byte past the end of the stack-allocated line array. This can lead to denial of service, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. When processing an input line that, after potential concatenation with previous buffered data, would exceed the TEMP_BUF_SIZE buffer, the 'llen' variable is adjusted to 'TEMP_BUF_SIZE - gopherState->len - 1'. Subsequently, a null terminator is written at 'line[llen + 1] = '\0';'. If 'gopherState->len' is 0, 'llen' becomes 'TEMP_BUF_SIZE - 1', causing the null terminator to be written at 'line[TEMP_BUF_SIZE]', which is one byte past the end of the 'line' buffer. This out-of-bounds write can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
