"1","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, accessing memory that it does not own, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code allocates memory using MALLOC(sizeof(instanceConf_t)). If MALLOC fails to allocate memory (e.g., due to system resource exhaustion) and returns NULL, and the CHKmalloc macro does not correctly handle this NULL return by immediately propagating an error or jumping to the finalize_it label, then the subsequent attempts to dereference 'inst' (e.g., inst->next = NULL;, inst->pszBindPort = NULL;) will result in a null pointer dereference. This can lead to a program crash, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. The vulnerability is contingent on the specific implementation of the CHKmalloc macro."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not handle the resulting error.","The code dereferences the loadModConf pointer (e.g., loadModConf->tail, loadModConf->root) without first checking if loadModConf itself is a non-NULL pointer. If loadModConf is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash or denial of service. Additionally, the output parameter pinst is dereferenced without a NULL check, which could also lead to a NULL pointer dereference if a NULL pinst is passed by the caller."
