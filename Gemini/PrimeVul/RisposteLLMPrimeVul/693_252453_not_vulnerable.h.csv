"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly handles buffer sizing and null termination, preventing buffer overflows. The filename length 'n' is read from the central directory header. Before copying, 'n' is limited by 'filename_buf_size - 1' using MZ_MIN, ensuring that the copy operation does not exceed the provided buffer's capacity. A null terminator is then correctly placed at pFilename[n]. The function also handles cases where the central directory header is not found or when filename_buf_size is zero, without introducing vulnerabilities."
