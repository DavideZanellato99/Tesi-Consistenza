"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The function SetUnknownShape takes an integer output_port as input and passes it directly to ctx->set_output without any validation. If output_port is a negative value or exceeds the valid range of output ports for the InferenceContext, it could lead to an out-of-bounds write when ctx->set_output attempts to access or modify memory outside its allocated buffer. This can result in denial of service, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index","The product uses an array index that is not validated, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write.","The code snippet does not validate the `output_port` parameter before passing it to `ctx->set_output`. If `output_port` is a negative value or an excessively large value, it could lead to an out-of-bounds access within the `set_output` method, potentially causing a crash or other undefined behavior if an attacker can control this value."
