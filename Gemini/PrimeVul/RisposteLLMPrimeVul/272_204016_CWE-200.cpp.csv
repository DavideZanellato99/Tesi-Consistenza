"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer that is smaller than the input buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code uses a stack-allocated buffer to store a squashfs_dir_entry_2 structure and a variable-length filename. The dire pointer is cast to squashfs_dir_entry_2 *. The read_directory_data function is then called to write dire->size + 1 bytes into dire->name. If the 'name' field within the squashfs_dir_entry_2 structure is a fixed-size array that is smaller than SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN, this operation will result in a stack-based buffer overflow, overwriting memory beyond the bounds of the 'name' field on the stack."
"2","True","CWE-120","Classic Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `buffer` is allocated to hold a `squashfs_dir_entry_2` structure followed by `SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN + 1` bytes for the filename. However, `dire->name` is a member within the `squashfs_dir_entry_2` structure, typically a small fixed-size array (e.g., `char name[1]`). When `read_directory_data` is called to read `dire->size + 1` bytes into `dire->name`, it writes past the bounds of this small internal array, overflowing into subsequent memory within the `buffer` array. This can lead to data corruption or denial of service."
