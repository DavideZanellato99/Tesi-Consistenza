"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a number by zero, which can lead to an application crash or other undesirable behavior.","The code is vulnerable to a floating-point division by zero error if 'gTimeseriesBucketMaxCount' is zero when processing a time-series buckets collection. Specifically, the calculation for 'minAdvancedToWorkRatio' involves the term 'kCoefficient * numRecords * gTimeseriesBucketMaxCount' in the denominator. Although 'numRecords' is checked to be non-zero, 'gTimeseriesBucketMaxCount' is not. If 'gTimeseriesBucketMaxCount' is zero, this division will result in either a Not-a-Number (NaN) if 'sampleSize' is also zero, or an Infinity/Negative Infinity value if 'sampleSize' is non-zero. Passing such a value to the 'TrialStage' constructor can lead to unpredictable behavior, incorrect plan selection, or a denial of service if the 'TrialStage' implementation does not gracefully handle these floating-point edge cases."
