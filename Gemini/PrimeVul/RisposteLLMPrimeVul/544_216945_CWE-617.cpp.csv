"1","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The program does not release a block of memory after it is no longer needed. This can lead to a gradual increase in memory consumption over time, potentially causing the program to run out of memory and crash or become unresponsive.","The code exhibits memory leaks on several error paths. If memory allocation for cloned items or the equality object fails, or if adding the equality to the list fails, previously allocated memory (e.g., for left_item_clone or right_item_clone) is not explicitly released. This can lead to unnecessary memory consumption within the thd->mem_root arena, potentially causing premature out-of-memory conditions or denial of service."

"3","True","CWE-401","Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime","The product allocates memory during its operation, but it does not free the memory after it has finished using the memory. This can lead to a gradual reduction in available memory, which can eventually cause the product to crash or become unresponsive.","The code allocates memory for Item clones and Item_func_eq objects using a memory pool (thd->mem_root). In several error paths, if an allocation succeeds but a subsequent operation (e.g., another allocation or adding to a list) fails, the previously allocated objects are not explicitly deallocated or linked into a structure that would manage their lifetime. Although the memory pool will eventually be cleared, these orphaned objects consume memory within the pool until it is reset. Repeated occurrences of this scenario, especially under memory pressure, could lead to premature exhaustion of the memory pool, potentially causing a Denial of Service."
