"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The function put_u32_le writes 4 bytes to the memory location pointed to by `vp` without validating that the buffer is large enough to accommodate these 4 bytes. If `vp` points to a buffer smaller than 4 bytes, or is a null pointer, an out-of-bounds write or null pointer dereference will occur, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or potential arbitrary code execution."
