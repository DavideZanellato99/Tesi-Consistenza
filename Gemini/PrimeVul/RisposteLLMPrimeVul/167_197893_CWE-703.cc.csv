"1","True","CWE-20","Improper Input Validation","The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that input. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting, if the unvalidated input is used in a way that allows an attacker to control the program's behavior or access sensitive information.","The code snippet directly uses `params.axis` and `params.batch_dims` without validating their values against the dimensions of the `input` tensor. Additionally, the indices within the `positions` tensor are passed to `optimized_ops::Gather` without explicit bounds checking. If `params.axis` is an invalid dimension index or if the `positions` tensor contains out-of-bounds indices, this lack of validation can lead to an out-of-bounds read or other memory access violations within the `optimized_ops::Gather` function."
