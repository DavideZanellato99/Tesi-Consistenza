"1","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The code uses the 'file' argument directly in the fopen() function without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker who can control the 'file' argument could supply a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ""../"") to access or create files outside the intended directory, leading to unauthorized file system access."

"4","True","CWE-22","Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')","The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause it to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.","The `file` argument, which can be controlled by an attacker, is directly used in the `fopen()` call without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths, potentially leading to a path traversal vulnerability where sensitive information from other files on the system could be disclosed."
