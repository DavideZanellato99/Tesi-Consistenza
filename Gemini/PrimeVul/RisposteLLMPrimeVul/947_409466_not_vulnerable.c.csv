"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code snippet is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The function get_termcode checks if the input index i is greater than or equal to tc_len but does not check if i is less than zero. If a negative value is passed for i, it will result in an out-of-bounds access to the termcodes array, leading to a read from an invalid memory location."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer.","The code snippet is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The function get_termcode takes an integer i as an index. While it checks for i >= tc_len to prevent accessing beyond the end of the termcodes array, it does not check if i is negative. If a negative value is passed for i, it will result in an array index underflow, attempting to access memory before the start of the termcodes array, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
