"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The program writes to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. This can lead to corruption of data, a crash, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code performs complex pointer arithmetic to manage memory for function frames, including arguments, local variables, and temporary values. Pointers like new, value, p, and local are calculated based on value_count, function->u.lambda->temp, and function->args_count. These counts are derived from the active function frame and function object. If these derived counts are not properly validated and can be manipulated by an attacker (e.g., through a crafted JavaScript function), the pointer arithmetic can lead to out-of-bounds writes. Specifically, the while loop copies njs_value_t elements and stores pointers to them, and the for loop copies pointers to arguments. If the calculated memory regions for these operations extend beyond the bounds of the allocated njs_frame_t structure and its associated data, it will result in a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow arbitrary code execution.","The code calculates several pointers (e.g., new, value, native->local, native->temp) based on offsets from the native frame structure. These calculations use values like value_count, function->u.lambda->temp, function->args_offset, and njs_function_frame_args_count(active). If these values, potentially influenced by attacker-controlled input, cause the calculated pointers to extend beyond the allocated memory region for the frame structure, subsequent write operations (e.g., *p = *start++, *new++ = p++, *local++ = p++) will result in out-of-bounds writes. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. The code lacks explicit bounds checks to prevent these out-of-bounds writes."
