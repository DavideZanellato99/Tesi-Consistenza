"1","True","CWE-193","Off-by-one Error","An off-by-one error occurs when a loop iterates one time too many or one time too few, or when a buffer is allocated one byte too many or one byte too few. This can lead to buffer overflows, buffer underflows, or incorrect calculations.","The calculation for bbox->width contains an off-by-one error. The expression (int) floor(max.x - min.x) - 1 subtracts one from the correctly floored width, resulting in a bounding box that is one unit too narrow. This can lead to incorrect rendering, clipping of content, or, more severely, buffer overflows if this undersized width is subsequently used for memory allocation or array indexing, causing writes beyond the intended buffer boundaries."

"3","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value, or that the value will not exceed an arbitrary maximum. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The calculation for bbox->width is (int) floor(max.x - min.x) - 1;. If max.x - min.x is a value between 0.0 (exclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive), floor(max.x - min.x) will evaluate to 0. Subtracting 1 from this will result in bbox->width being -1. A negative width is an invalid dimension for a bounding box. If this negative width is later cast to an unsigned integer type for memory allocation or array indexing, it will wrap around to a very large positive number, potentially leading to an integer overflow, heap overflow, or denial of service."
