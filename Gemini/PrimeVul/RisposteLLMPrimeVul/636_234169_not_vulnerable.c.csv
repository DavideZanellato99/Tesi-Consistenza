"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to point to valid memory, and the pointer's value is NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer typically causes a program to crash, which may lead to a denial of service.","The code does not check if the 'data' pointer is NULL before dereferencing it in the 'byte_get' function call within the loop. If 'data' is NULL and 'data > end' evaluates to false (e.g., if 'end' is a valid address), the loop will attempt to read from a NULL address, leading to a segmentation fault or access violation and a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory, leading to a crash or other unpredictable behavior. This typically happens when a pointer is used before it has been initialized or after it has been freed, and its value is NULL.","The code does not validate if the 'data' pointer points to a valid, accessible memory region before dereferencing it within the loop. If 'data' is a NULL pointer or points to an unmapped memory address, dereferencing it via 'byte_get(data++, 1)' will lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior, resulting in a denial of service."
