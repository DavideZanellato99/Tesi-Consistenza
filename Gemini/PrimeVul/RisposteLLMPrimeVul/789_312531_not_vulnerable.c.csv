"1","True","CWE-672","Improper Restoration of State","The product does not properly restore the state of a resource after it has been changed, which can leave the resource in an unexpected or vulnerable condition.","The code temporarily modifies a global state variable, curwin, within a loop. If an exceptional condition, such as a non-local jump (e.g., longjmp in C), occurs within the qf_set_title_var function, the curwin variable might not be restored to its original value. This improper restoration of state can lead to an inconsistent program state, causing subsequent operations to fail, operate on an unintended window, or potentially result in crashes if the temporarily assigned window becomes invalid."

"5","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs operations on a shared resource in an order that can be influenced by an external actor, leading to a race condition. This can result in unexpected behavior, data corruption, or denial of service.","The code temporarily modifies the global variable 'curwin' within a loop and restores it afterwards. In a multi-threaded environment, if this function is called concurrently, a race condition can occur where one thread's modification of 'curwin' is overwritten by another thread before the first thread's operation (qf_set_title_var) completes or before 'curwin' is restored, leading to an incorrect window context for operations and potential data corruption or unexpected behavior."
