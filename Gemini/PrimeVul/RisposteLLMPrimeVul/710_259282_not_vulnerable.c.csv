"1","True","CWE-323","Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption","The product reuses a nonce or key pair in an encryption operation, which can weaken the encryption or make it vulnerable to attacks. For example, in some modes of operation for block ciphers, reusing an Initialization Vector (IV) with the same key can lead to serious vulnerabilities such as plaintext recovery.","The code incorrectly handles the Initialization Vector (IV) for AES CBC mode decryption when processing multiple subsamples. The IV is initialized once from sample->iv at the beginning of the function. However, for each subsequent subsample within the loop, the same initial IV is reused for the av_aes_crypt call. In correct CBC mode operation, for chained blocks or segments, the IV for a subsequent block/segment should be the ciphertext of the preceding block/segment. By reusing the original IV for every subsample, the cryptographic chaining property of CBC mode is broken, leading to a loss of semantic security and potential information leakage if identical plaintext blocks appear at the beginning of different subsamples."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code copies 16 bytes from 'sample->iv' into a local buffer 'iv' using 'memcpy'. However, it does not check the 'sample->iv_size' field to ensure that 'sample->iv' points to at least 16 bytes. If 'sample->iv_size' is less than 16, 'memcpy' will attempt to read beyond the bounds of the buffer pointed to by 'sample->iv', leading to an out-of-bounds read. This can cause a crash (denial of service) or potentially leak sensitive information from adjacent memory regions."
