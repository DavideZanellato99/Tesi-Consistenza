"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end or before the beginning of the buffer.","The function accesses 'args[idx]' without performing any bounds checking on the 'idx' parameter. If 'idx' can be controlled by an attacker or can exceed the allocated size of the 'args' array, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The function accesses args[idx] without performing any bounds checking on the idx parameter. If idx is negative or exceeds the allocated size of the args array, this will result in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other memory corruption issues."
