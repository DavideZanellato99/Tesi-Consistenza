"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.","The code performs an addition operation on the 'size' member of the GF_Box structure without checking for potential integer overflow. If 's->size' is close to the maximum value representable by its data type, adding '2' could cause an integer overflow, leading to the size wrapping around to a smaller or negative value. This incorrect size could then be used in subsequent memory allocations or buffer operations, potentially resulting in heap overflows, buffer overflows, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues if the overflowed value is used in a subsequent memory allocation or access.","The code performs an addition `s->size += 2`. If `s->size` is an integer type and its current value is close to the maximum representable value for that type, adding `2` could cause an integer overflow. This would result in `s->size` wrapping around to a small or unexpected value. If this `size` is subsequently used for memory allocation, buffer sizing, or loop bounds, it could lead to a heap buffer overflow, stack buffer overflow, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities when a larger amount of data than the allocated size is written."
