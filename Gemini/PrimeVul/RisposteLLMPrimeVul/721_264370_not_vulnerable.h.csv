"1","True","CWE-843","Type Confusion","Type confusion occurs when a program accesses a resource with a type that is different than the type that was intended or assumed by the programmer. This can lead to out-of-bounds access, incorrect data interpretation, or other undefined behavior.","The function TensorProtoData is specialized for qint32, implying it handles data of type qint32. However, it retrieves data from t.int_val().data(), which is explicitly a pointer to int32 data. If qint32 is a distinct type from int32 and not layout-compatible, this creates a type confusion vulnerability. A caller might incorrectly assume the returned const int32* points to qint32 objects and attempt to reinterpret_cast and access it as such, leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or information disclosure. The reinterpret_cast within the snippet itself is a no-op (int32* to int32*), but the misleading interface design is the root cause of the potential type confusion."

"3","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource using a type that is incompatible with the resource, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This can occur when a program attempts to interpret data of one type as if it were of another, or when it uses a pointer to a different type to access memory. Such type confusion can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code performs a reinterpret_cast from a pointer to qint32 data to a const int32* pointer. This is a strict aliasing violation and a form of type confusion.
