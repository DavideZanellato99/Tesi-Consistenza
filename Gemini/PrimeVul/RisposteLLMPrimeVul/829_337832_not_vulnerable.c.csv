"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the result of the calculation is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer type. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The `len` parameter is a signed integer. When `sizeof(dp) + len` is calculated to determine the allocation size, if `len` is a negative value with an absolute magnitude greater than `sizeof(dp)`, an integer underflow will occur. This underflowed value, when implicitly converted to an unsigned type for memory allocation by `sctp_make_data`, will become a very large positive number. This can lead to an attempt to allocate an extremely large buffer, potentially causing a denial of service due to memory exhaustion, or if the allocation succeeds, it could create a large buffer that is then vulnerable to heap overflows if subsequent operations write data assuming the intended smaller size."
