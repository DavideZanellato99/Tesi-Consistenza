"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but could be NULL, typically leading to a crash or exit.","The code snippet calls an allocation macro ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC and then returns the resulting pointer 'tmp' without checking if the memory allocation was successful. If the allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), 'tmp' could be NULL. Returning an unchecked NULL pointer can lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the calling code if the caller does not validate the returned pointer before use, potentially causing a denial of service."
