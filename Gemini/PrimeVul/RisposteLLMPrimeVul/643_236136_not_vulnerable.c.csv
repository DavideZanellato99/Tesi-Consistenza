"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The program attempts to dereference a pointer that has not been initialized or has been set to NULL, which can lead to a crash or other unpredictable behavior, often resulting in a denial of service.","The ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC macro likely allocates memory for GF_TextHighlightBox and assigns it to tmp. If the memory allocation fails, tmp will be NULL. If the macro then proceeds to initialize members of tmp without checking if tmp is NULL, it will result in a NULL pointer dereference within the macro's expansion before the pointer is returned."

"4","True","CWE-562","Return of Stack Variable Address","The program returns the address of a local variable, which is allocated on the stack. When the function returns, the stack frame is deallocated, and the memory pointed to by the returned address becomes invalid. Subsequent dereferencing of this pointer will lead to undefined behavior, which can include crashes, data corruption, or information disclosure.","The code snippet likely uses the ISOM_DECL_BOX_ALLOC macro to declare a local variable named 'tmp' on the stack. The function then returns a pointer to this local stack variable. Once the function returns, its stack frame is deallocated, rendering the returned pointer a dangling pointer. Any subsequent attempt to dereference this pointer will result in undefined behavior, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or information disclosure."
