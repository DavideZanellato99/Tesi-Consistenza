"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other unpredictable behavior.","The code attempts to access memory at 'dl->str + dl->length - so_ext_len' without first verifying that 'dl->length' is greater than or equal to 'so_ext_len'. If 'dl->length' is smaller than 'so_ext_len', the pointer arithmetic will result in an address before the start of the 'dl->str' buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read when 'my_strcasecmp' is called. This can cause a crash (denial of service) or potentially leak sensitive information from adjacent memory."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic of the product does not properly anticipate and handle this condition. This can introduce other weaknesses when the computation is used as a basis for resource allocation or indexing into a memory region.","The calculation `dl->length + so_ext_len + 1` for memory allocation can suffer from an integer overflow if `dl->length` is sufficiently large, close to `SIZE_MAX`. If this sum overflows, the `alloc_root` function will allocate a smaller buffer than required. Subsequently, the `memcpy` and `strcpy` operations will write past the end of this undersized buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure."
