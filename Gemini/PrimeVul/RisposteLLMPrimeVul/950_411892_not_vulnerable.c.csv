"1","True","CWE-617","Reachable Assertion","The product contains an assertion that is reachable by an attacker, which can lead to a denial of service.","The code contains a tor_assert(tok->n_args >= 2); statement. If an attacker can provide a specially crafted input string that causes the tokenize_string function to produce a token where n_args is less than 2, this assertion will trigger, leading to program termination. This constitutes a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, as a malicious input can crash the service processing these extra-info documents."
