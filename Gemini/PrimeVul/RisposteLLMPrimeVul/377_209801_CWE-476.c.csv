"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application attempts to use a pointer that points to no valid location in memory, and the application does not handle the resulting error. This typically leads to a program crash or denial of service.","The code dereferences the 'prog' pointer (prog->type) without first checking if 'prog' is a valid, non-NULL pointer. If 'prog' is NULL, this will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash and denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-362","Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')","The product performs two or more operations that are intended to be atomic, but the product does not properly synchronize them, which can allow an attacker to interrupt the sequence and cause an unexpected state.","The code snippet uses a global or file-scope variable 'minify' to store a configuration value. If the function 'jsP_dumpsyntax' is called concurrently by multiple threads, a race condition can occur where one thread's assignment to 'minify' is overwritten by another thread before the first thread can use its intended value, leading to unpredictable behavior and incorrect program logic."
