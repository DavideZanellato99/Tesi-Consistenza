"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously initialized to NULL, which can cause a crash or exit.","The code retrieves a fastrpc_buf pointer from dmabuf->priv and assigns it to buffer without checking if dmabuf->priv is NULL. If dmabuf->priv is NULL, the subsequent dereference of buffer->dev in the call to dma_get_sgtable will lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a kernel panic and a denial of service. Additionally, if kzalloc succeeds but dma_get_sgtable fails, the allocated memory for 'a' is not freed, leading to a memory leak."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The program dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but which is NULL, which can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.","The code dereferences dmabuf->priv to initialize buffer, and then subsequently dereferences buffer (e.g., buffer->dev, buffer->lock) without checking if dmabuf or dmabuf->priv are NULL. Similarly, attachment->dev is dereferenced without checking if attachment is NULL. If any of these pointers are NULL, it will lead to a null pointer dereference and likely a kernel crash."
