"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the number will always be positive or will not exceed a certain size. This can introduce other weaknesses when the computation result is used in other operations, such as buffer allocation or indexing, leading to issues like out-of-bounds reads or writes.","The `len` variable, an `int`, is used to calculate the length of the `uri` string. If an attacker provides an extremely long `uri` string that exceeds `INT_MAX` characters, the `len` variable will overflow during the `for (len = 0; uri[len]; len++)` loop. When `len` overflows to a negative value (a common outcome of signed integer overflow, which is undefined behavior), the subsequent array access `uri[len]` within the loop becomes an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a denial of service (crash) or potentially information disclosure."
"2","True","CWE-129","Improper Validation of Array Index","The product uses an array index that is not properly validated, leading to an out-of-bounds read or write. This can result in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.","The code contains a buffer underflow vulnerability. If the input URI is an empty string and the 'prefix->name' is NULL (indicating a default namespace declaration), the variable 'len' will be 0. Subsequently, if 'parser->m_namespaceSeparator' is enabled, the code attempts to write to 'b->uri[len - 1]', which evaluates to 'b->uri[-1]'. This results in an out-of-bounds write before the beginning of the allocated buffer 'b->uri'."
