"1","True","CWE-269","Improper Privilege Management","The product does not properly manage privileges, leading to a situation where a user or process has more privileges than it should, or where privileges are not dropped or acquired correctly.","The code attempts to drop privileges by calling setuid before setgid. When a root process drops privileges, calling setuid first causes the process to lose its root user ID. Subsequently, the non-root process may lack the necessary permissions to fully drop its group privileges via setgid, potentially retaining elevated group IDs (e.g., root GID). This is an improper privilege management vulnerability due to incorrect order of operations, leading to a partial privilege drop."
"2","True","CWE-272","Incomplete Privilege Demotion","The software attempts to reduce its privileges but fails to do so completely, leaving some privileges enabled that are not required for the program's subsequent operations.","The code attempts to drop privileges using setuid and setgid but fails to address supplementary groups. If the process was running with elevated privileges and had supplementary groups, these groups are not dropped, potentially allowing the process to retain unintended access or privileges. To properly drop all group-related privileges, setgroups should be called before setgid to clear or set the supplementary group list."
