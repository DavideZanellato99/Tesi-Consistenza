"1","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer that is smaller than the input buffer, causing a buffer overflow.","The code contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The 'buffer' array is declared with a size of 64 bytes. However, in the code block handling BMP versions 4 or 5 (where 'Bitmap_File_Head.biSize' is 108 or 124), the 'ReadOK' function is called to read 'Bitmap_File_Head.biSize - 4' bytes into this buffer. If 'Bitmap_File_Head.biSize' is 108, 104 bytes are read, overflowing the 64-byte buffer by 40 bytes. This can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior."
"2","True","CWE-121","Stack-based Buffer Overflow","The product copies an input buffer to a stack-based buffer that is smaller than the input buffer, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to corruption of data, a crash, or arbitrary code execution.","The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. When processing BMP files with header sizes 108 or 124 (Bitmap_File_Head.biSize), the function attempts to read `Bitmap_File_Head.biSize - 4` bytes into a stack-allocated buffer `buffer` which has a fixed size of 64 bytes. If `Bitmap_File_Head.biSize` is 108, 104 bytes are read, overflowing the buffer by 40 bytes. If `Bitmap_File_Head.biSize` is 124, 120 bytes are read, overflowing the buffer by 56 bytes. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service."
