"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The 'start' and 'end' variables are calculated based on 'screen->scrolling_region' and 'screen->insert_delta', which can be influenced by attacker-controlled escape sequences. These 'long' values are then passed to internal functions '_vte_terminal_ring_remove' and '_vte_terminal_ring_insert'. If these internal functions do not perform robust bounds checking on 'start' and 'end' against the actual size of the terminal's ring buffer, an attacker could craft specific escape sequences to cause 'start' or 'end' to be negative or excessively large. This could lead to an out-of-bounds memory write (via '_vte_terminal_ring_insert') or read (via '_vte_terminal_ring_remove'), potentially resulting in denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other data corruption.","The code decrements `screen->cursor_current.row` without checking if it is already at its minimum valid value of 0. If the cursor is at row 0, this operation will cause `screen->cursor_current.row` to underflow to a negative value. This negative index can then be used in subsequent operations to access memory out-of-bounds, leading to a denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution."
