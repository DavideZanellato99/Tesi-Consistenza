"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The build_dirs function iterates through the src path and constructs a corresponding dst path. Pointers p and q are incremented in parallel, with p traversing src and q traversing dst. The function does not receive the allocated size of the dst buffer. If the length of the path derived from src (after src_prefix_len) is longer than the available capacity of the dst buffer (after dst_prefix_len), the pointer q will eventually go out of bounds. Subsequent write operations, such as *q = '\0' or *r = '/' (where r is updated to q), will then write past the end of the dst buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (buffer overflow). This can corrupt adjacent memory, cause a crash, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution."
