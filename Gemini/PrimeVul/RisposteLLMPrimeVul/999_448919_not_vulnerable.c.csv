"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The software performs operations on a heap-allocated buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location outside of the intended bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a crash, data corruption, or execution of arbitrary code.","The function copies internal state pointers without consistent bounds checks. The pointer adjustment for copy->next lacks the bounds validation present for copy->lencode and copy->distcode. If state->next in the source stream is corrupted to point outside its intended state->codes array, copy->next will become an out-of-bounds pointer. Subsequent operations on copy->next could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, arbitrary memory write, or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or in some cases, allow for arbitrary code execution.","The code copies internal state pointers using arithmetic. While `lencode` and `distcode` pointers are checked to ensure they remain within bounds relative to `codes`, the `next` pointer lacks this crucial bounds validation. If `state->next` in the source stream is corrupted to point outside its expected range relative to `state->codes`, the calculation `copy->codes + (state->next - state->codes)` will cause `copy->next` to point to an arbitrary memory location. Subsequent dereferencing of `copy->next` can lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, resulting in memory corruption or denial of service."
