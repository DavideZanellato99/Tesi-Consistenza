"1","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the input or an intermediate result is larger than the maximum value for the intended data type. This can lead to a buffer overflow, incorrect calculations, or other unexpected behavior.","The calculation `x = 1 << k;` can result in an integer overflow if `k` is sufficiently large, leading to undefined behavior or a very large value for `x`. The subsequent calculation for the allocation size, `sizeof(Bigint) + (x-1)*sizeof(Long)`, can then overflow the `size_t` type, causing `MALLOC` to allocate a much smaller buffer than required. Since `rv->maxwds` is set to the original (potentially large) value of `x`, any later operations that use `rv->maxwds` to determine the buffer's capacity could lead to a heap buffer overflow by writing past the end of the undersized allocated memory. Furthermore, the code does not check if `MALLOC` returns `NULL`, which could result in a null pointer dereference."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product performs a calculation that can result in an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic expects the calculation to be performed on a larger integer type or when it has not adequately accounted for the possibility of overflow. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or other security-critical operations.","The code calculates the allocation size using (x-1)*sizeof(Long). If k is sufficiently large, x (calculated as 1 << k) can be a large positive integer. The subsequent multiplication (x-1)*sizeof(Long) can then overflow a 32-bit integer, resulting in a smaller, wrapped-around value being passed to MALLOC. This leads to an undersized buffer allocation. Later, when rv->maxwds (which holds the original large value of x) is used to access elements within the allocated Bigint structure, it can result in a heap-based buffer overflow."
