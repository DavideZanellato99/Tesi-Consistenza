"1","True","CWE-78","Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')","The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component for execution.","The code is vulnerable to OS command injection (CWE-78) as it uses an attacker-controlled environment variable (EDITOR/VISUAL) to construct and execute a command via system(), allowing arbitrary command execution. Furthermore, it creates a temporary file with a predictable name in /tmp, leading to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367) that could result in arbitrary file overwrite or information disclosure."
