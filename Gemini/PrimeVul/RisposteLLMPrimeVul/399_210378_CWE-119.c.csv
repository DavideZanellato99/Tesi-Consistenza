"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to a crash, corruption of the heap, or execution of arbitrary code.","The xmlParseStartTag2 function is vulnerable to a double-free. If xmlCtxtGrowAttrs fails during attribute parsing, the allocated attribute value (attvalue) is freed, but the local attvalue pointer is not nulled. If a subsequent input buffer change (e.g., via GROW macro) triggers the base_changed condition within the same loop iteration, the dangling attvalue pointer will be freed again, leading to a double-free vulnerability, heap corruption, and potential arbitrary code execution."

"3","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or exposure of sensitive information.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In error handling paths (e.g., `xmlCtxtGrowAttrs` failure or `failed` label), if `xmlParseAttribute2` allocates an attribute value (`attvalue`) of length `len` that is not null-terminated, the condition `attvalue[len] == 0` attempts to read one byte past the allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash, information disclosure, or a memory leak if the `xmlFree` call is skipped due to the out-of-bounds read returning a non-zero value."
