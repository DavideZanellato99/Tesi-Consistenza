"1","True","CWE-122","Heap-based Buffer Overflow","The product uses a fixed-size heap-based buffer, but it can read or copy more data than the buffer's capacity, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect length calculations, improper use of string manipulation functions, or failure to check the size of input data.","The code calculates _data->maxSampleCountTableSize by multiplying _data->tileDesc.ySize, _data->tileDesc.xSize, and sizeof(int). The _data->tileDesc.ySize and _data->tileDesc.xSize values are derived from the file header, which is untrusted input. If these values are maliciously crafted to be sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum value representable by the integer type used for the calculation (e.g., size_t), leading to an integer overflow. This overflow would result in _data->maxSampleCountTableSize being a much smaller value than intended. Subsequently, _data->sampleCountTableBuffer.resizeErase() would allocate a buffer of this incorrect, smaller size. If later operations attempt to write data into _data->sampleCountTableBuffer based on the actual (larger) expected size, it would result in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-190","Integer Overflow or Wraparound","The product of two or more numbers is greater than the maximum value representable by the data type used to store the result, leading to an incorrect, truncated, or wrapped-around value. This can lead to buffer overflows, incorrect memory allocations, or other exploitable conditions.","The calculation of _data->maxSampleCountTableSize involves multiplying _data->tileDesc.ySize, _data->tileDesc.xSize, and sizeof(int). The values _data->tileDesc.ySize and _data->tileDesc.xSize are derived from the file header, which can be controlled by a malicious actor. If these values are sufficiently large, their product can exceed the maximum representable value for the type of _data->maxSampleCountTableSize (likely size_t), leading to an integer overflow. This overflow would cause _data->maxSampleCountTableSize to wrap around to a smaller, incorrect value. Consequently, the subsequent call to _data->sampleCountTableBuffer.resizeErase() would allocate a buffer that is too small. Any subsequent operations attempting to write the intended amount of data into this undersized buffer would result in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution."
