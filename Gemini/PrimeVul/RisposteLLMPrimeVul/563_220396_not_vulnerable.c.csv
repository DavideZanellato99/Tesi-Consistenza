"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet implements robust bounds checking and length adjustments for array access. It handles single indices, ranges, and index-length pairs by validating the start index and length against the array's actual size. Negative indices are correctly adjusted, and lengths are capped to prevent reading beyond the array's end. All calculated indices and lengths are checked before being passed to internal functions like ary_subseq or mrb_ary_ref, preventing out-of-bounds access or integer overflows within the scope of this snippet."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended input buffer. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or the exposure of sensitive information.","The code snippet delegates array element access for single index and range access (MRB_TT_RANGE, MRB_TT_INTEGER, and default cases) to external functions such as mrb_ary_ref and mrb_range_beg_len (which then calls ary_subseq) without performing explicit bounds checks within the provided snippet itself for these specific paths. If these external helper functions do not adequately validate the provided index or range parameters against the array's actual bounds, an attacker could provide a malicious index or range, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the array. While the two-argument access path (mrb_get_args with 'oi') includes robust bounds checking logic within the snippet, the single-argument paths rely entirely on the correctness and completeness of bounds checking within the delegated functions, which is a common source of vulnerabilities."
