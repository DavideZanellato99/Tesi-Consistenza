"1","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking that the input buffer will not overflow the output buffer.","The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. In the ASCII file reading path, the `fscanf(msh->hdl, ""%s"", str);` call uses the `%s` format specifier without a maximum width limit. This allows an attacker to provide a crafted file containing a string longer than the `GmfStrSiz` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. Additionally, the `FilNam` argument is used directly in `open()` and `fopen()` calls without sanitization, making the code vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the system."

"3","True","CWE-120","Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')","The software copies an input buffer to an output buffer without properly checking the size of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.","The fscanf(msh->hdl, ""%s"", str) call in the ASCII file reading path (when msh->typ & Bin is false) does not limit the number of characters read into the 'str' buffer, which is of fixed size GmfStrSiz. If a malicious file contains a string longer than GmfStrSiz, it will cause a buffer overflow on the stack, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the use of va_arg without proper validation of the argument types in both read and write modes can lead to undefined behavior, including potential arbitrary writes (when expecting int*) or reading of garbage values (when expecting int), which could result in crashes or unexpected program states.
