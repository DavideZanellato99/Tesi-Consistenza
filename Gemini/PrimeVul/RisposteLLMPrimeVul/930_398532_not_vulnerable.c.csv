"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly performs a bounds check (attr_code < RZ_ARRAY_SIZE(dwarf_attr_encodings)) before accessing the dwarf_attr_encodings array. If the attr_code is out of the array's bounds, the code proceeds to a switch statement that handles specific values or returns NULL, preventing any out-of-bounds read or other memory access issues. The input parameter attr_code is of type ut64 (unsigned 64-bit integer), so it cannot be negative, making the lower bound check implicit."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet safely retrieves a DWARF attribute name based on an attribute code. The initial array access is protected by a bounds check using RZ_ARRAY_SIZE, and since attr_code is an unsigned 64-bit integer (ut64), it cannot be negative, preventing out-of-bounds reads. The subsequent switch statement handles specific, sparse attribute codes, and the default case correctly returns NULL for unknown codes. No vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or null pointer dereferences are apparent within this snippet."
