"1","True","CWE-79","Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')","The software receives input from an untrusted source that is not properly neutralized before it is returned to the user in the output page. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web page, which can then be executed by other users.","The `throwError` function accepts a `std::string text` which, if originating from untrusted input and not properly sanitized, can lead to injection vulnerabilities when the `ParseException` message is later displayed to users. This function does not perform input sanitization, making it a potential vector for attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the error message is rendered in an insecure context."
"2","True","CWE-117","Improper Output Neutralization for Logs","The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that are used in logs, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary log entries or to forge log records.","The `throwError` function takes a `std::string text` and uses it directly in a `ParseException` without any sanitization. If `text` originates from untrusted input and the `ParseException` message is later written to a log file, an attacker could inject malicious content, such as forged log entries or control characters, by including them in the `text` parameter. This could lead to log forging, log poisoning, or other forms of log injection, making it difficult to analyze logs for legitimate security incidents."
