"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a simple wrapper function that directly passes its arguments to security_context_to_sid. It does not perform any operations that could introduce new vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or null pointer dereferences within this snippet itself. Any potential vulnerabilities would reside in the security_context_to_sid function or in how this wrapper is called with untrusted inputs, not in the wrapper's logic."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The program reads data from a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end or before the beginning of the buffer.","The function `selinux_secctx_to_secid` passes the `secdata` pointer and `seclen` length directly to `security_context_to_sid` without performing any validation to ensure that `seclen` does not exceed the actual allocated size of the buffer pointed to by `secdata`. If `secdata` and `seclen` originate from an untrusted source and `seclen` is maliciously crafted to be larger than the buffer, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read within `security_context_to_sid`, potentially exposing sensitive kernel memory or causing a denial of service."
