"1","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product performs a division operation where the divisor is not guaranteed to be non-zero, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code calculates a rate by dividing total_chars by the elapsed time. If the elapsed time (time((time_t *) 0) - started) is zero, this will result in a floating-point division by zero, producing an infinite or NaN value for the rate. While this typically does not crash the program, it can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect output, which might be exploitable if the calculated rate is used in security-sensitive operations or resource management."
"2","True","CWE-369","Divide By Zero","The product divides a value by zero, which can lead to a crash or an exploitable condition.","The code calculates a rate by dividing `total_chars` by the elapsed time `(time((time_t *) 0) - started)`. If `time((time_t *) 0)` is equal to `started`, the denominator becomes zero, leading to a floating-point division by zero. This results in `INF` or `NaN` being printed, indicating an unhandled error condition and potentially leading to incorrect program behavior or further issues if the result is used elsewhere."
