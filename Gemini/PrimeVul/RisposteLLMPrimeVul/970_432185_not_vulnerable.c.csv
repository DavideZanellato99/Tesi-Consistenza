"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The function `can_merge` directly dereferences pointers `r1` and `r2` (e.g., `r1->addr`, `r2->addr.start`) without performing any checks to ensure that these pointers are not NULL. If either `r1` or `r2` is a NULL pointer when the function is called, attempting to access their members will result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a program crash or undefined behavior."
