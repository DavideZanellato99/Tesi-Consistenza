"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not confirmed to be valid, which can lead to a crash or exit.","The code dereferences the 'idA' pointer without checking if it is a null pointer. If 'idA' is a null pointer, dereferencing it will lead to a program crash (segmentation fault), resulting in a denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","A NULL pointer dereference occurs when an application attempts to use a pointer that has not been assigned to valid memory address and is instead NULL. This typically causes the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.","The code dereferences the idA pointer (*idA) without checking if idA is a null pointer. If idA is nullptr at the time of dereference, this will lead to a program crash (segmentation fault or access violation), resulting in a denial of service."
