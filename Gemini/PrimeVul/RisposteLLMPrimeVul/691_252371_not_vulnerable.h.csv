"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The code snippet correctly uses `fopen_s`, a safer alternative to `fopen`, to open a file. `fopen_s` ensures that the file pointer is set to NULL on failure, preventing the use of uninitialized pointers. The function returns the file pointer, and it is the caller's responsibility to check if it's NULL and to close the file. This snippet itself does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities."
