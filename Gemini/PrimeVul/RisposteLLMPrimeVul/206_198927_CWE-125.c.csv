"1","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior.","The code contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the 'moveable' entry point processing (when bundle_type is 0xff), the 'segnum' value read from the untrusted input is used to index 'bin->segment_entries' after subtracting one, without proper bounds checking against the size of the 'bin->segment_entries' array (which is implicitly defined by 'bin->ne_header->SegCount'). An attacker can craft a malicious file with a 'segnum' value greater than the actual number of segments, leading to an out-of-bounds read from 'bin->segment_entries', potentially causing a crash or information leak."
"2","True","CWE-125","Out-of-bounds Read","The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can often lead to crashes or other failures that can be used to trigger a denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read. The bounds check `tableat + off + 4 >= r_buf_size (bin->buf)` is insufficient for 'moveable' entry types which are 5 bytes long. If a 5-byte 'moveable' entry is located at the end of the buffer such that the read of `ut16 segoff` starts at `r_buf_size (bin->buf) - 1`, it will attempt to read one byte past the end of the buffer. Additionally, the `off` variable is incorrectly incremented by one byte too many for both 'moveable' and 'fixed' entry types within the loop, leading to an off-by-one error that causes misalignment and misinterpretation of subsequent entry data."
