"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. The `stack_pos` pointer, which writes to `ctx->stack_base`, is incremented without any bounds checking against the allocated size of `ctx->stack_base`. A malicious or malformed LZW input stream could cause the `while` loop to push an excessive number of bytes onto the stack, leading to a buffer overflow on `ctx->stack_base`."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution.","The code performs writes to the `stack_pos` buffer without validating that `stack_pos` remains within the allocated bounds of `ctx->stack_base`. Specifically, the `*stack_pos++ = ...` operations, especially within the `while` loop that reconstructs the decoded string, lack boundary checks. An attacker providing a specially crafted LZW input that decodes into a sequence longer than the `ctx->stack_base` buffer can cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability can result in denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other memory corruption issues."
