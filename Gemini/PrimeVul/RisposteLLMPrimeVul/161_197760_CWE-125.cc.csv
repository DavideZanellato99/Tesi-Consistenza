"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a type dispatch mechanism that handles various data types and explicitly reports an error for unsupported types. It does not contain direct vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string bugs within its scope. Potential vulnerabilities would reside in the implementation of the called GatherNd functions or in the validation of input tensors prior to this function, which are outside the scope of this snippet."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is a type dispatching mechanism for the EvalGatherNd function. It uses a switch statement to call different template instantiations of GatherNd or GatherNdString based on the input tensor's data type. For unsupported types, it correctly reports an error and returns an error status. This snippet itself does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or improper input validation. Potential vulnerabilities related to out-of-bounds access or other memory safety issues would reside within the implementations of the GatherNd or GatherNdString functions, which are not included in this snippet."
