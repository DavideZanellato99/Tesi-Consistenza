"1","True","CWE-415","Double Free","The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to a crash, corruption of the heap, or execution of arbitrary code.","The code attempts to free the 'offsets' member if 'aux_info_type' matches specific schemes. However, the check 'if (ptr->offsets)' only prevents freeing a NULL pointer, not a pointer that has already been freed but not set to NULL. If 'ptr->offsets' is freed elsewhere and not set to NULL before this function is called, it will result in a double-free vulnerability, potentially leading to heap corruption or a crash. Additionally, if 'ptr->offsets' points to a non-heap memory region, calling 'gf_free' on it would lead to memory corruption or a crash."
"2","True","CWE-843","Type Confusion","The product performs an operation on an object based on the assumption that the object is of a certain type, but it is actually of a different type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.","The code performs an unchecked downcast from GF_Box* to GF_SampleAuxiliaryInfoOffsetBox*. If the input GF_Box* s does not actually point to a GF_SampleAuxiliaryInfoOffsetBox instance, accessing members like aux_info_type, aux_info_type_parameter, flags, version, entry_count, or offsets through the ptr pointer will result in type confusion. This can lead to reading or writing data at incorrect memory locations, causing undefined behavior, crashes, or potentially exploitable memory corruption."
