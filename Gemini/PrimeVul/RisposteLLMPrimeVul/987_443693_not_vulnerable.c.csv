"1","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is an initialization block that defines string literals and populates arrays with constant values, then calls macros to register these configurations. There are no direct vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or memory management issues within this specific snippet. The string literals are correctly terminated, and array accesses are within bounds. Potential vulnerabilities would reside in the implementation of the called macros or the functions they register, which are not provided for analysis."
"2","False","N/A","N/A","N/A","The provided code snippet is an initialization block that defines internal callout functions and their properties using hardcoded string literals and constant values. There is no user input processed directly by this snippet, no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation, and no complex logic that could introduce common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or integer overflows. The use of UTF-16LE encoded string literals is a specific implementation detail and not a vulnerability in itself. The snippet appears to be a safe configuration of internal library components."
