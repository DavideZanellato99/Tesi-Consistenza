"1","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The product uses recursion without sufficiently limiting the recursion depth, which can lead to a stack overflow. This can result in a denial of service or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the stack overflow can be controlled.","The function uses recursion to implement a flood-fill algorithm. In scenarios with large images or complex fill patterns (e.g., long, narrow, winding shapes), the recursion depth can become excessively large, potentially exceeding the program's stack limit and leading to a stack overflow. This can result in a denial of service."

"4","True","CWE-674","Uncontrolled Recursion","The software contains a recursive function that does not sufficiently limit the depth of recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow.","The gdImageFillToBorder function uses recursion to fill areas above and below the current scanline. If the image is large and the fill area is extensive or complex, the recursive calls can lead to an excessive recursion depth. This can exhaust the program's stack space, resulting in a stack overflow and a denial of service (DoS) condition. There are no explicit checks or mechanisms to limit the recursion depth."
