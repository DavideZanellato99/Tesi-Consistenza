"1","True","CWE-476","NULL Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has not established to be valid, accessing memory that it does not own, which can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.","The code allocates memory for st->orgpat using ALLOC_ONE(pat_T). However, it fails to check if this allocation was successful (i.e., if st->orgpat is NULL) before dereferencing it multiple times, such as st->orgpat->pat = pat; and st->orgpat->len = (int)STRLEN(pat);. If ALLOC_ONE fails and returns NULL, these dereferences will lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference, causing a crash or denial of service."
"2","True","CWE-476","Null Pointer Dereference","The product dereferences a pointer that it has previously initialized to NULL, which can cause a crash or other undefined behavior.","The code allocates memory for st->orgpat using ALLOC_ONE(pat_T) but fails to check if the allocation was successful before dereferencing st->orgpat to assign values to st->orgpat->pat and st->orgpat->len. If ALLOC_ONE returns NULL, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a program crash. Additionally, the function performs multiple memory allocations. If an allocation fails and the function returns FAIL, any memory successfully allocated prior to the failing allocation is not freed, resulting in a memory leak."
