"1","True","CWE-843","Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')","The product accesses a resource with a type that is incompatible with the resource's actual type, which can lead to unexpected behavior.","The code performs an unchecked type cast of hnti->SDP to GF_SDPBox * before accessing its sdpText member. If hnti->SDP points to an object of an incompatible type, an attacker could craft a malicious file to cause type confusion, leading to memory corruption, arbitrary free, or other undefined behavior when sdpText is accessed and freed."

"3","True","CWE-416","Use-After-Free","A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This can lead to various issues, including crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution, depending on how the freed memory is subsequently reallocated and used.","The code accesses `hnti->SDP` and then `((GF_SDPBox *)hnti->SDP)->sdpText` without sufficient checks to ensure that `hnti` or `hnti->SDP` point to valid, allocated memory. If the `GF_HintTrackInfoBox` object pointed to by `hnti` or the `GF_SDPBox` object pointed to by `hnti->SDP` has been freed prior to this function call, dereferencing these pointers would result in a Use-After-Free vulnerability, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."
