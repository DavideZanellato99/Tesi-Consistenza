"1","True","CWE-665","Improper Initialization","The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might lead to unexpected control flow or data values.","The kmemdup function performs a shallow copy of the em28xx structure. If struct em28xx contains pointers to dynamically allocated resources (e.g., buffers, other kernel objects, mutexes, etc.) that are intended to be unique to each device instance, then both the original dev and the duplicated sec_dev will share these resources. This improper duplication means the new device is not fully initialized with its own distinct resources, which can lead to various issues such as double-free vulnerabilities if both instances attempt to free the same shared resource, use-after-free vulnerabilities if one instance frees a resource while the other continues to use a dangling pointer, or data corruption due to unsynchronized access to shared state. The function name 'duplicate_dev' strongly implies a need for a deep copy of all owned resources."
