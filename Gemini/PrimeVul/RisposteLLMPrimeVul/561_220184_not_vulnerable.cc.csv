"1","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or in some cases, allow execution of arbitrary code.","The code calculates an index 'dst_index' by counting existing data input edges to a node. This index is then used to add a new edge and update the node's input list. If an attacker can craft a graph where the 'dst' node has an excessive number of existing data inputs, 'dst_index' could exceed the maximum allowed capacity for inputs to that node. If the 'IsValidInputTensor' function fails to properly validate 'dst_index' against this maximum capacity, subsequent operations like 'AddEdge' or 'dst->props_->node_def.add_input' could attempt to write data beyond the allocated buffer for the node's inputs, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This vulnerability could result in memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution."
"2","True","CWE-787","Out-of-bounds Write","The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of an intended buffer. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or lead to the execution of arbitrary code.","The `dst_index` is calculated by counting existing input edges. If an attacker can control the number of existing edges, `dst_index` could become excessively large. If the underlying input storage is a fixed-size buffer and `IsValidInputTensor` or subsequent operations like `AddEdge` and `add_input` do not properly validate `dst_index` against this buffer's capacity, an out-of-bounds write could occur, leading to memory corruption or denial of service. The 'Hack' in the function name suggests potential deviations from standard safety practices."
